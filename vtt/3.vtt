<i>I'm afraid your services
won't be required here, sir.</i>

2
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.760
<i>My men have examined
the evidence,</i>

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.600
<i>and this is obviously
an accident.</i>

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.960
<i>What?!</i>

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.840
<i>Duck-tective will return
after these messages.</i>

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.560
That duck is a genius.

7
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.560
Eh. It's easier to find clues
when you're that close
to the ground.

8
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.440
Are you saying you could
outwit duck-tective?

9
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.320
Mabel, I have very keen
powers of observation.

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.240
For example,
just by smelling your breath

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.040
I can tell that
you have been eating...

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.960
An entire tube of toothpaste?

13
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.800
- It was so sparkly.
- Hey, dudes!

14
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.840
You'll never guess
what I found!

15
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.720
- Buried treasure!
- Buried...

16
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.640
Hey, I was gonna say that!

17
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.480
So I was cleaning up
when I found this secret door

18
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.400
hidden behind the wallpaper.

19
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.280
It's crazy-bonkers-creepy.

20
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.080
Whoa! It's a secret wax museum.

21
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.000
They're so life-like.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.960
Except for that one.

23
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.800
Hello!

24
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.720
Ha ha! It's just me,
your Grunkle Stan!

26
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.280
Behold the Gravity Falls
Wax museum.

27
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.280
It was one of our most
popular attractions!

28
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.280
Before I forgot all about it.

29
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.160
I got 'em all...
genghis Khan, Sherlock Holmes,

30
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.040
some kind of,
I don't know, Goblin Man.

31
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.960
Ooh! Is anyone else
getting the creeps here?

32
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.880
And now for
my personal favorite...

33
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.720
wax Abraham Lincoln,
right over...

34
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.640
oh, no! Come on!

35
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.560
Who left the blinds open?!

36
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.440
Wax John wilkes booth,
I'm lookin' in your direction.

37
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.320
How do you fix a wax figure?

38
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.240
Cheer up, Grunkle Stan.

39
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.160
- Where's that smile?
- Meh.

40
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.080
- Beep bop boop.
- Ow.

41
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.840
Don't worry, Grunkle Stan,
I'll make you a new wax figure
from all this old wax.

42
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.800
You really think you could
make one of these puppies?

43
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.680
Grunkle Stan,
I'm an arts and crafts master.

44
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.560
Why do you think I always have
this glue gun stuck to my arm?

45
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.400
- Eeech!
- I like your gumption, kid.

46
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.360
I don't know
what that word means,
but thank you.

47
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.160
Dipper.

48
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
What do you think
of my wax figure idea?

49
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.040
She's part fairy princess,

50
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.000
and part <i>horse </i>fairy princess.

51
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.880
Maybe you should carve
something from real life.

52
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.720
Like a waffle with big arms!

53
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.600
Yo-kay, or, ya know,
something else,

54
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.480
like someone in your family.

55
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.440
Kids! Have you
seen my pants?

56
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.200
O muse, you work
in mysterious ways.

57
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.200
Why is your sister
talking to the ceiling?

58
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.440
I think it needs more glitter.

59
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.440
Agreed.

60
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.280
I found my pants,
but now I'm missing my...

61
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.120
What do you think?

62
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.920
I <i>think </i>the wax museum's
back in business!

63
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.520
I can't believe
this many people
showed up.

64
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.400
I know, right?

65
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400
Your uncle probably
bribed 'em or something.

66
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.200
He bribed me.

67
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.880
You all know me, folks,
town doll and Mr. Mystery.

68
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.840
Please, ladies!
Control yourselves!

69
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.680
As you know, I always bring
the people of this fair town

70
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.520
novelties and befuddlements,

71
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.520
the likes of which
the world has never known.

72
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.360
But enough about me.

73
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360
Behold...

74
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.360
Me!

75
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.120
♪ Ye-ah!
Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah! ♪

76
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.880
And now a word from
our own Mabelangelo.

77
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.840
It's Mabel.

78
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.760
Thank you for coming.

79
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.600
I made this sculpture
with my own two hands!

80
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.480
It's covered in my blood,
sweat, tears,

81
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.480
and other fluids.

82
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.400
- Ugh! - Ohh!
- Ewww!

83
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.240
Heh heh. Yeah.

84
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.240
I will now take questions.
You there.

85
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.080
Old man mcgucket, local kook.

86
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.040
Are the wax figures alive?
And, follow-up question,

87
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.960
can I survive
the wax man uprising?

88
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.840
Um... Yes! Next question.

89
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.640
Toby determined,
Gravity Falls gossiper.

90
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.560
Do you <i>really </i>think
this constitutes
a wonder of the world?

91
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.520
Your microphone's
a turkey baster, Toby.

92
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.440
- It certainly is.
- Next question.

93
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.280
Shandra jimenez,
a <i>real </i>reporter.

94
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.080
Your fliers promised
free pizza with admission
to this event.

95
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.040
Is this true?

96
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.000
- That's what <i>I </i>heard.
- Come on!

97
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.920
- What a rip-off!
- I want my pizza.

98
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.800
That was a typo.

99
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.720
Good night, everyone!

100
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.600
Ohhh.

101
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.360
In your face!

102
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.360
We're not coming back <i>here.</i>

103
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.280
I think that went well.

104
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.040
Hot pumpkin pie!
Look at all this cash!

105
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.000
And I owe it all
to one person...

106
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.880
This guy.

107
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.840
Ooh! Yeah, you too,
ya little gremlin.

108
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.720
Now, you kids wash up.
We got another long day
of fleecing rubes tomorrow.

109
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.560
Go! Go!

110
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.600
Ahh, kids.

111
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.480
<i>Well, duck-dective,</i>

112
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.360
<i>it seems you've really
"quacked" the case.</i>

113
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.600
Ha ha!

114
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.640
Stupid duck.

115
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.520
Well, I'm gonna use the John.

116
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.480
You need anything?

117
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.240
I love this guy!
Don't you go nowhere.

118
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.880
- Dipper, you wanna do a toothbrush race?
- Okay.

119
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.600
No... No... Nooooo!

120
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.560
Wax Stan! He's been...
Murdered!

121
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.200
Ohhh!

122
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.080
I got up to use the John,
right?

123
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.960
And when I come back,
blammo! He's headless!

124
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.760
My expert handcrafting
besmirched.

125
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.760
Besmirched!!!

126
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.680
Who would <i>do </i>something
like this?

127
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.480
What's your opinion,
sheriff blubs?

128
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.440
Look, we'd love
to help you folks,

129
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.240
but let's face the facts...
this case is unsolvable.

130
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.240
- What?! You take that back, sheriff blubs!
- What? - What?

131
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.080
You're kidding, right?
There must be evidence, motives.

132
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.880
- Ya know, I could help, if you want.
- He's really good.

133
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.880
He figured out who was
eating our tin cans.

134
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.800
All signs pointed to the goat.

135
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.720
Yeah, yeah, let the boy help.

136
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.600
He's got a little brain
up in his head.

137
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.520
Whoo! Would you look
at what we got here!

138
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.400
<i>City </i>boy thinks
he's gonna solve a mystery

139
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.360
with his fancy computer phone!

140
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.200
City Bo-oy!
City Bo-oy!

141
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.120
You are <i>adorable.</i>

142
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.000
Adorable?

143
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.960
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

144
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.840
Look P.J.'s,

145
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.840
how about you leave
the investigatin'
to the grown-ups?

146
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.720
<i>Attention, all units.</i>

147
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.520
<i>Steve is going to fit an entire
cantaloupe in his mouth.</i>

148
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.560
<i>Repeat, an entire cantaloupe.</i>

149
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.480
- It's a 2316!
- Let's move.

150
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.280
That's it! Mabel, you and me
are going to find the jerk
who did this

151
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.160
and get back that head!

152
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.120
Then we'll see who's <i>adorable.</i>

153
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.920
Aw. You sneeze
like a kitten.

154
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.920
Wax Stan has lost his head,

155
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.840
and it's up to us to find it.

156
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.720
There were a lot of unhappy
customers at the unveiling.

157
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.520
The murderer could
have been anyone.

158
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.480
Yeah! Even us!

159
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.360
In this town,
anything is possible,
ghosts, zombies...

160
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.200
could be months before
we find our first clue.

161
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.200
Hey, look, a clue!

162
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.000
Footprints in the shag carpet.

163
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
That's weird.
They've got a hole in them.

164
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.960
And they're leading to...

165
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.720
So what do you think?

166
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.640
In my opinion, this is an ax.

167
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.520
Wait a minute...
the lumberjack!

168
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.400
Of course!

169
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.280
In your face!

170
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.280
He was furious when he
didn't get that free pizza.

171
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.080
Furious enough for murder!

172
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.120
Oh, you mean manley Dan?

173
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.000
He hangs out at this
crazy-intense biker joint
downtown.

174
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.880
Then <i>that's </i>where we're going.

175
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.880
Dude, this is awesome.

176
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.760
You two are like
the mystery twins.

177
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.720
Don't call us that.

178
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.520
Hey, gimme a hand
with this coffin,
will ya?

179
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.360
I'm doing a memorial service
for wax Stan.

180
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.320
Something small, but classy.

181
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.200
- Ooh!
- Sorry, Grunkle Stan,

182
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.080
- But we've got a big break in the case.
- Break in the case!

183
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.960
We're heading into town
right now to interrogate
the murderer.

184
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.840
We have an ax!
Ree! Ree! Ree!

185
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.760
Seems like the kind of thing
a responsible parent
wouldn't want you doing.

186
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.640
Good thing I'm an uncle.
Avenge me, kids!

187
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.480
Avenge me!!!

188
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.200
This is the place.

189
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.960
Got the fake I.D.'s?

190
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.880
Here goes nothing.

191
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.680
Sorry, but we don't
serve minors.

192
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.600
Dagnabbit!

193
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.440
We're here to interrogate
manley Dan the lumberjack

194
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.360
for the murder of wax Stan.

195
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.400
Deedle-eedle-eet.

196
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.280
Works for me.

197
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.680
He's resting.

198
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.520
All right, let's just
try to blend in, okay?

199
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.480
You got it, dipping sauce.

200
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.400
Hey, there, fellow
restaurant patron!

201
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.400
Bap!

202
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.240
Grrrr!

203
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.160
Aaaah!!!

204
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.000
Manley Dan!
Just the guy
I wanted to see.

205
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.920
- Where were you last night?
- Punchin' the clock.

206
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920
You were at work?

207
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.840
No, I was <i>punchin' </i>that clock!

208
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.640
Ten o'clock.
The time of the murder.

209
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.520
So I guess you've never
seen <i>this </i>before?

210
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.440
- Listen, little girl...
- Hey, actually, I'm...

211
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.360
I wouldn't pick my teeth
with that ax!

212
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.240
It's left-handed.
I only use my right hand.

213
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.160
The manly hand!

214
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.080
Hit him!
Hit him!

215
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.080
- Aaaah!
- Hee hee hee!

216
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.880
Left-handed...

217
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.880
Three, four, five, six.

218
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.640
Oh! Your wife
is gonna be beautiful.

219
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.640
Yes!

220
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.560
Mabel, big break in the case!

221
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.480
But will she love me?

222
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.360
It's a left-handed ax.

223
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.360
These are all our suspects.

224
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.240
Manley Dan is right-handed.

225
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.120
That means all we gotta do
is find our left-handed suspect

226
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.040
- and we've got our killer.
- Oh, man!

227
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.000
We are on <i>fire </i>today!

228
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.880
Pazow! Pazow! Pazow!

229
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.800
Let's find that murderer.

230
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.360
Mabel! There's only
one person left
on this list!

231
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.280
Of course!
It all adds up.

232
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120
You kids better
be right about this,

233
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.000
or you'll never
hear the end of it.

234
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.920
The evidence is irrefutable.

235
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.840
It's <i>so </i>irrefutable.

236
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.760
I'm gonna get to use
my night stick!

237
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760
You ready, little fella?

238
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.640
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Whoo! Whoo!

239
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.480
On three.
One, two...

240
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.520
- Heeyaw!
- Nobody move! This is a raid!

241
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.400
What is this,
some kind of raid?

242
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.200
Toby determined,
you're under arrest

243
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.040
for the murder of the wax body
of Grunkle Stan!

244
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.000
You have the right
to remain impressed

245
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.840
with our awesome
detective work.

246
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.880
Gobbling goose feathers!

247
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.720
I don't understand!

248
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.640
Then allow me to explain.

249
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.600
<i>You were hoping
that Grunkle Stan's
new attraction</i>

250
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.520
<i>would be the story that saved
your failing newspaper.</i>

251
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.360
<i>But when the show was a flop,</i>

252
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.240
<i>you decided to go out
and make your own headline.</i>

253
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.200
But you were sloppy,

254
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.080
<i>and all the clues pointed to</i>

255
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.960
<i>a shabby-shoed reporter
who was caught left-handed!</i>

256
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.840
Toby determined,
you're yesterday's news.

257
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.760
Boy, your little knees
must be sore

258
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.520
from jumping to conclusions!

259
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.520
Ha-cha-cha!

260
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.440
I had nothing to do
with that murder.

261
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.320
- I knew it! Wait... what...?
- Huh? Could you repeat...

262
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.160
Then where were you
the night of the break-in?

263
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.160
Uh...

264
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.960
<i>Finally we can be alone,</i>

265
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.800
<i>cardboard cut-out of
female news reporter
shandra jimenez!</i>

266
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.600
- Ew! - Ugh!
- Yuck!

267
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.600
Time stamp confirms it.
Toby, you're off the hook,

268
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.440
- you freak of nature.
- Hurray!

269
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.320
But... but it <i>has </i>to be him!
Check the ax for fingerprints.

270
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.160
No prints at all.

271
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.320
No prints?

272
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.240
Hey, I got a headline for ya:

273
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.120
"City kids waste
everyone's time."

274
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.800
Boy, I'd be pretty embarrassed
if I was you two!

275
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.480
Kids, Zeus,

276
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.400
lifeless wax figures,

277
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.400
thank you all for coming.

278
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.200
Some people might say
that it's wrong for a man

279
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.120
to love a wax replica
of himself.

280
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.040
- They're wrong!
- Easy, Zeus.

281
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.880
Wax Stan, I hope
you're pickin' pockets
in wax heaven.

282
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.760
I'm sorry, I got
glitter in my eye!

283
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.640
Oh, dude!

284
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.560
Huh. Those cops
were right about me.

285
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.520
Dipper, we've come so far.
We can't give up now.

286
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.320
But I considered everything...

287
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.200
the weapon, the motive,
the clues...

288
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.040
Huh. Wax Stan's shoe
has a hole in it.

289
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.080
All the wax guys have that.

290
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.840
It's where the pole thingie
attaches to their
stand dealies.

291
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.840
Wait a minute!

292
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.640
What has holes in its shoes
and no fingerprints?

293
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.560
Mabel! The murderers are...

294
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.440
standing right behind you?

295
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.240
Wax Sherlock Holmes!

296
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.280
Wax Shakespeare!

297
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.120
- Wax Coolio?
- What's up, Homes?

298
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.080
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

299
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.800
Congratulations,
my two amateur sleuths.

300
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.840
You've unburied the truth!

301
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.720
And now we're
going to bury <i>you.</i>

302
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.400
Bravo, Dipper Pines!

303
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.440
You've discovered
our little secret.

304
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.520
Applaud, everyone!

305
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.320
Applaud sarcastically!

306
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.320
Uh, no, that sounds
too sincere.

307
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.240
Slow clap.
<i>There </i>we go.

308
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.120
Nice and condescending.

309
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.080
But how is this possible?
You're made of wax!

310
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.880
Are you... Magic?

311
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.840
Are we magic?
She wants to know
if we're magic!

312
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.600
- We're cursed!
- Cursed! Cursed!

313
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.480
Cursed to come to life
whenever the moon is waxing.

314
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.240
Your uncle bought us
many years ago
at a garage sale.

315
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.160
A <i>haunted </i>garage sale, son!

316
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.920
I must warn you,
these statues come
at a terrible price.

317
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.800
Twenty dollars?!
I'll just take 'em
when you're not looking.

318
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.840
- What?
- I said I was gonna rob ya.

319
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.520
<i>And so the mystery shack
wax collection was born.</i>

320
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.520
<i>By day we would be
the playthings of man.</i>

321
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.320
<i>But when your uncle was asleep,
they would rule the night.</i>

322
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.160
- Hey. I told you to stop that.
- Make me.

323
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.040
Huh?

324
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.840
<i>It was a charmed life
for us cursed beings.</i>

325
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.680
<i>That is, until your uncle
closed up shop.</i>

326
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.920
<i>We've been waiting ten years
to get our revenge on Stan</i>

327
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.840
<i>for locking us away.</i>

328
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.640
<i>But we got the wrong guy.</i>

329
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.400
So you were trying to
murder Grunkle Stan for <i>real?</i>

330
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.240
You were right
all along, Dipper!
Wax people <i>are </i>creepy!

331
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.160
Enough! Now that
you know our secret,

332
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.080
you must die.

333
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.760
What do we do?
What do we do?!

334
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.760
I don't know!

335
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.480
Aaaah!

336
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.320
That's it!
We can melt them with
hotty melty things!

337
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.120
Anyone move, and we'll
melt you into candles!

338
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.120
<i>Decorative </i>candles!

339
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.000
You really think
you can defeat <i>us?</i>

340
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.840
- It's worth a shot, I guess.
- I'm not really sure.

341
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.760
So be it. Attack!

342
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.600
Aaah!

343
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.520
Uhh! Aaah!

344
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.440
Ohh! Aaah!

345
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.280

346
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.240
My neck!
My beautiful neck!

347
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.160
- Ahh!
- Joke's on you, groucho!

348
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.000
I've heard about
a cutting remark,
but this is ridiculous.

349
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.920
Hey, why is there
nothing in my hand?

350
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.640
Ha! Genghis Khan,
you fell harder than the...

351
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.480
Ah, I don't know, Jin Dynasty?

352
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480
Yeah. All right.

353
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

354
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.160
- What's up with that?
- Dipper, watch out!

355
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.000
All right, let's
get this taken care of.

356
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.480
Catch!

357
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.160
Uh... Uh...

358
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.080
Once your family
is out of the way,

359
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.920
we'll rule the night
once again!

360
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.920
Don't count on it!

361
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.720
Come back here, you brat!

362
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.520
Uh... Oh...

363
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.240
You really think
you can outwit me, boy?

364
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.160
I'm Sherlock bleeding Holmes!

365
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.000
Have you <i>seen
</i>my magnifying glass?!

366
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
It's enormous!

367
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.880
Oohh!

368
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.400
Any last words?

369
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.240
Um...
You got any sun screen?

370
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.120
Got any... What?!

371
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.000
- No.
- You know, letting me lead you outside,

372
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.880
Probably not your
sharpest decision.

373
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.800
Outsmarted by a child
in short pants!

374
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.720
Noooo!

375
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.560
Fiddlesticks!
Humbugs!

376
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.400
It's a total kerfuffle!

377
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.400
What a hullaballoo!

378
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.320
Case closed.

379
00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.080
Ha ha ha!
You sneeze like a kitten.

380
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.000
Those policemen were right,
you're adorable.

381
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.920
Adorable!!!

382
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.800
Eww.

383
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.680
♪ Though our group
been cleft in twain ♪

384
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.640

385
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.560
- You know any limericks?
- Uh...

386
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.400
There once was
a dude from Kentucky...

387
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.400
- Nope.
- Aaah!

388
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.280
Dipper! You're okay!

389
00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.240
You solved the mystery
after all.

390
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.040
I couldn't have done it
without my sidekick.

391
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.000
No offense, Dipper,
but you're the sidekick.

392
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.960
What? Says who?
Are people saying that?
Have you heard that?

393
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.840
Hot Belgian waffles!

394
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.720
What happened to my parlor?!

395
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.640
Your wax figures
turned out to be evil,

396
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.520
so we fought them to the death!

397
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.520
I decapitated Larry King.

398
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.440
Ha ha! You kids
and your imaginations.

399
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.280
On the bright side, though,
look what we found.

400
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.160
My head! Ha ha!

401
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.080
I missed this guy.

402
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.040
You done good, kids!

403
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.000
Line up for some
affectionate noogying.

404
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.800
I'm not so sure about that.
Is there any other alternative?

405
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.800
Ha ha! Noogy, noogy, noogy!

406
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.600
Solve the case yet, boy?

407
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.520
I'm so confident
you're gonna say no

408
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.320
that I'm gonna take
a long, slow sip from
my cup of coffee.

409
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.160
Actually, the answer is yes.

410
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.080
Aaaaah!

411
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.040
Ow!

412
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.920
Aah!

413
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.880
- It burns! It burns!
- My eyes!

414
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.680
They got scalded!

415
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.520
So, did you get rid
of <i>all </i>the wax figures?

416
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.480
I am 99% sure that I did.

417
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.360
Good enough for me.

418
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.200
Ha ha ha ha!

419
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.080
Huh?

420
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.960
So, you're a rat.
Tell me about that.

421
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.880
Hey! Get back here!

422
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.880
I'm hopping!

423
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.680
I'm hopping after a rat
that stole my ear!

424
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.520
Hmm. Hey, Dipper,

425
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.520
what do you think is better,

426
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.360
sequins or llama hair?

427
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.360
The llama hair.

428
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.240
Llamas are nature's
greatest warriors.

429
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.040
Thanks, Dipper!
