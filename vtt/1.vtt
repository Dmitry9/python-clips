00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.760
<i>Ah, summer break...</i>

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.720
- You want cheese on that hon?
- Sure, Hank.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.800
<i>A time for leisure, recreation,</i>

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.720
<i>and takin' 'er easy...</i>

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.760
<i>Unless you're me.</i>

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.600
Aaaah!!!

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.400
It's getting closer!

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.120
<i>My name is Dipper.</i>

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.920
<i>The girl about to puke
is my sister Mabel.</i>

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.880
<i>You may be wondering what
we're doing in a golf cart</i>

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.800
<i>fleeing from a creature
of unimaginable horror.</i>

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.760
- Aah!
- Aaah!

13
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.640
- Look out!
- Aahh!

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.400
<i>Rest assured,
there's a perfectly
logical explanation.</i>

15
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.800
<i>Let's rewind.</i>

16
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.400
<i>It all began</i>

17
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.400
<i>when our parents decided
we could use some fresh air.</i>

18
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.200
<i>They shipped us up north
to a sleepy town</i>

19
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.080
<i>called Gravity Falls, Oregon,</i>

20
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.880
<i>to stay at our great-uncle's
place in the woods.</i>

21
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.840
This attic is amazing!

22
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.680
Check out all my splinters!

23
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.680
Baaa!

24
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.560
And there's a goat on my bed.

25
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560
Hey, friend.

26
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.360
Oh! Yes, you can keep
chewing on my sweater.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

27
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.160
<i>My sister tended to look
on the bright side of things.</i>

28
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.120
Yay! Grass!

29
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.000
<i>But I was having a hard time</i>

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.920
<i>getting used to
our new surroundings.</i>

31
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.920
- Boo!
- Aaaah!

32
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.840
Aha ha ha ha!

33
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.760
<i>And then was
our great-uncle Stan...</i>

34
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.640
<i>that guy.</i>

35
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.640
Aha ha ha ha...

36
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.480
It was worth it.

37
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.360
<i>Our uncle had transformed
his house into a tourist trap</i>

38
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.400
<i>he called the Mystery Shack.</i>

39
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.240
<i>The real mystery was
why anyone came.</i>

40
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.160
Ladies and gentlemen, behold...

41
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.040
the sascrotch!

42
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.960
- Whoa!
- Oh, my gosh!

43
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.800
<i>And guess who
had to work there.</i>

44
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800
Oh!

45
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.720
No touching the merchandise!

46
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.560
<i>It looked like it was gonna be
the same boring routine</i>

47
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560
<i>all summer,</i>

48
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.400
<i>until one fateful day...</i>

49
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.240
He's looking at it.
He's looking at it!

50
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.160
Uh...

51
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.040
"Do you like me?

52
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.960
"Yes. Definitely.

53
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.960
Absolutely"?

54
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.840
- I rigged it!
- Mabel,

55
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.680
I know you're going through
your whole "boy crazy" phase,

56
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.600
- but I think you're kind of overdoing
it with the "crazy" part.
- What?!

57
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.480
<i>Come on, Dipper!</i>

58
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.440
This is our first summer
away from home.

59
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.200
It's my big chance to have
an epic summer romance.

60
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.080
Yeah, but do you need to flirt
with every guy you meet?

61
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.960
My name is Mabel,
but you can call me
the girl of your dreams.

62
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.840
I'm joking!
Ha ha ha ha!

63
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.640
Oh, my gosh, you like turtles?

64
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.520
<i>I like turtles too.
What is happening here?</i>

65
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.400
Come one, come all,

66
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.280
to the mattress prince's
kingdom of savings!

67
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.280
- Take me with you.
- Aaah!

68
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.160
Mock all you want, brother,

69
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.080
but I got a good feeling
about this summer.

70
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.920
I wouldn't be surprised
if the man of my dreams

71
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.800
walked through that door
right now.

72
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.600
Oh! Oh! Not good. Ow.

73
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.560
- Oh, why?!
- Ha ha ha!

74
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.560
All right, look alive, people.

75
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.560
I need someone to go
hammer up these signs in
the spooky part of the forest.

76
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.560
- Not it! - Not it!
- Uh, also not it.

77
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560
Nobody asked you, Soos.

78
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.400
I know, and I'm
comfortable with that.

79
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.360
Wendy! I need you
to put up this sign!

80
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.160
I would, but I... uhh...
can't... uhh... reach it.

81
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.080
I'd fire all of you if I could.

82
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.960
All right, let's make it
eeny-meeny-miney...

83
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.840
- You.
- Oh! What?

84
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.720
Grunkle Stan,
whenever I'm in those woods
I feel like I'm being watched.

85
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.640
<i>- Ahh, this again.
- I'm telling you,</i>

86
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.520
Something weird is going on
in this town.

87
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.480
Just today my mosquito bites
spelled out "beware."

88
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.320
That says "bewarb."

89
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.120
Look, kid, the whole
"monsters in the forest" thing
is just local legend

90
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.000
drummed up by guys like me
to sell merch to guys like that.

91
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.840
So quit being so paranoid!

92
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.560
Ugh. Grunkle Stan.

93
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.400
Nobody ever believes
anything I say.

94
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.320
Huh?

95
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.640
Baaa!

96
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.480
What the...?

97
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.800
"It's hard to believe
it's been six years
since I began studying

98
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.640
the strange
and wondrous secrets
of Gravity Falls, Oregon."

99
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.400
<i>What is all this?</i>

100
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.240
"Unfortunately, my suspicions
have been confirmed.

101
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.200
"I'm being watched.

102
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.120
<i>"I must hide this book
before he finds it.</i>

103
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.920
Remember, in Gravity Falls,
there is no one you can trust."

104
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.920
No one you can trust...

105
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.800
- Hello!
- Aaah!

106
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.720
Whatcha readin'?
Some nerd thing?

107
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.640
Uh... uh... it's nothing.

108
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.520
"Uh-uh... it's nothing."

109
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.400
What? Are you
actually not gonna show me?

110
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.360
Uh...

111
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.280
Let's go somewhere private.

112
00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.160
It's amazing!

113
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.080
Grunkle Stan said
I was being paranoid,

114
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.920
but according to this book,
Gravity Falls has this
secret dark side.

115
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.840
<i>Whoa! Shut up!</i>

116
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.760
After a certain point,

117
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.680
the pages just stop,

118
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.560
like the guy who was writing it
mysteriously disappeared.

119
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.400
Who's that?

120
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.360
Well, time to spill the beans.

121
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.280
Broop. Beans.

122
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.240
This girl's got a date.
Whoo whoo!

123
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.160
- Ha ha ha!
- Let me get this straight.

124
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.920
In the half hour I was gone
you already found a boyfriend?

125
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.920
What can I say?

126
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.800
I guess I'm just irresistible!

127
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.640
Oh!

128
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640
Coming!

129
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.520
- What you readin' there, slick?
- Oh!

130
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.320
I was just catchin' up on,
uh...

131
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.280
- "Gold chains for old men magazine"?
- That's a good issue.

132
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.160
Hey, family!

133
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.080
Say hello to my new boyfriend!

134
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.880
'Sup?

135
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.920
- Hey.
- How's it hangin'.

136
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.800
<i>We met at the cemetery.
He's really deep.</i>

137
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.720
Ooh! Little muscle there.

138
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.520
What...
what a surprise.

139
00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.560
So what's your name?

140
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.360
Uh... Normal... Man!

141
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.360
He means "Norman."

142
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.240
Are you bleeding, Norman?

143
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.120
It's jam.

144
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.960
<i>Oh! I love jam!</i>

145
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.840
<i>Look at this!</i>

146
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.680
So, you wanna go hold hands
or... whatever?

147
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.680
Oh! Oh, my goodness.

148
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.680
Don't wait up!

149
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.360
<i>There was something about
Norman that wasn't right.</i>

150
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.200
<i>I decided to consult
the journal...</i>

151
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.120
"Known for their pale skin
and bad attitudes,

152
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.000
"these creatures
are often mistaken for...
Teenagers?!

153
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.840
"Beware Gravity Falls's
nefarious...

154
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.720
'Sup?

155
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.600
Zombie!"

156
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.560
Did somebody say "cromby"?
What is that, "cromby"?

157
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.440
It's not even a word.
You're losin' your mind.

158
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.160
I like you.

159
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.040
Oh, no! Mabel!

160
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.880
- No! No, Mabel! Watch out!
- Uhh!

161
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.840
Aaaah!

162
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.680
Uhh.

163
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.840
Daisies?

164
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.840
You scallywag!

165
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.120
Is my sister really
dating a zombie,

166
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.360
or am I just going nuts?

167
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.240
It's a dilemma, to be sure.

168
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.280
I couldn't help but overhear you
talking aloud to yourself
in this empty room.

169
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.480
Soos, you've seen
Mabel's boyfriend.

170
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.360
He's gotta be a zombie, right?

171
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.320
Hmm. How many brains
did you see the guy eat?

172
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.160
- Zero.
- Look, dude, I believe you.

173
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.120
I'm always noticing
weird stuff in this town.

174
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.920
Like the mailman? Pretty sure
that dude's a werewolf.

175
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.680
But you gotta have evidence.

176
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.520
Otherwise people are gonna think
you're a major league
cuckoo clock.

177
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.480
As always, Soos, you're right.

178
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.360
My wisdom is both a blessing
and a curse.

179
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.160
Soos!
The portable toilets
are clogged again!

180
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.120
I am needed elsewhere.

181
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.880
<i>My sister could be in trouble.</i>

182
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.800
<i>It was time to get
some evidence.</i>

183
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.560
Aaauuggh!

184
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Aaah!

185
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.960
Aauggh!

186
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.720
<i>I'd seen enough.</i>

187
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.560
Mabel, we've gotta
talk about Norman.

188
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.400
<i>Isn't he the best?
Check out this giant
smooch mark he gave me!</i>

189
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.240
- Aaah!
- Ha ha!

190
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.080
Gullible. It was just
an accident with
the leaf blower.

191
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.960
Kissing practice!

192
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.920
Mmm... Mmm...

193
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.800
Aah! Turn it off!

194
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.680
<i>Turn it off!</i>

195
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.680
- That was fun.
- No! Mabel, listen.

196
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.360
I'm trying to tell you
that Norman is not
what he seems!

197
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.240
You think
he might be a vampire?

198
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.280
<i>That would be so awesome!</i>

199
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.120
Guess again, sister.

200
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.120
- Sha-bam!
- Aaah!

201
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.960
Oh, wait. I'm...
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.920
- Sha-bam!
- A zombie?

203
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.920
That is not funny, Dipper.

204
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.880
I'm not joking!

205
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.760
It all adds up:
the bleeding, the limp...

206
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.600
He never blinks!
Have you noticed that?

207
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.440
<i>Maybe he's blinking
when you're blinking.</i>

208
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.440
Mabel, remember
what the book said
about Gravity Falls?

209
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.320
"Trust no one"!

210
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.240
<i>What about me, huh?
Why can't you trust me?</i>

211
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.200
- Beep-bop!
- Mabel!

212
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.120
He's gonna eat your brain!

213
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.960
Dipper, listen to me.

214
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.960
Norman and I are going
on a date at five o'clock,

215
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.640
<i>and I'm gonna be adorable,
and he's gonna be dreamy.</i>

216
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.680
- Wait! But... but... but...
- And I'm not gonna let you ruin it

217
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.520
with one of your
crazy conspiracies!

218
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.320
Ohh. What am I gonna do?

219
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.280
Coming!

220
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.160
Hey, Norman.
How do I look?

221
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.040
Shiny!

222
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.840
You always know what to say!

223
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.760
Soos is right.

224
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.600
I don't have any real evidence.

225
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.520
I guess I can be kind of
paranoid sometimes, and...

226
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.360
<i>wait! What?!</i>

227
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.200
Aaah! I was right!
Oh, my God!

228
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.080
Oh, my God! Grunkle Stan!
Grunkle Stan! Grunkle Stan!

229
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.920
And here we have
"rock that looks
like a face" rock...

230
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.840
the rock that
looks like a face.

231
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.800
- Does it look like a rock?
- No, it looks like a face.

232
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.640
<i>- Is it a face?
- It's a rock that looks like a face!</i>

233
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.600
Over here!
Grunkle Stan!

234
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.400
For the fifth time,
it's not an actual face!

235
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.320
Grrrr!!!

236
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.160
Finally, we're alone.

237
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.040
<i>Yes... Alone.</i>

238
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.960
Stan! Stan!

239
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.960
Wendy! Wendy!

240
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.760
I need to
borrow the golf cart so I can
save my sister from a zombie!

241
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.600
Try not to hit any pedestrians.

242
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.440
Dude, it's me, Soos.

243
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.280
- This is for the zombies.
- Thanks.

244
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.240
And this is in case
you see a piñata.

245
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.040
Uh... Thanks?

246
00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.000
Better safe than sorry!

247
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.960
Mable,

248
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.760
now that we've gotten
to know each other,

249
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.760
there's...

250
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.640
There's something
I should tell you.

251
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.520
<i>Oh, Norman!
You can tell me anything!</i>

252
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.440
<i>Please be a vampire,
please be a vampire.</i>

253
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.280
All right, just...
just don't freak out, okay?

254
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.240
Just... just keep an open mind.
Be cool.

255
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.840
Is this weird?
Is this too weird?

256
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.880
You need to sit down?

257
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.800
R-right. I'll explain.

258
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.480
So, we're gnomes, first off,
get that one out of the way.

259
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.520
- Uh...
- I'm Jeff,

260
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.360
and here we have Carson, Steve,

261
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.080
Jason and...

262
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.280
I'm sorry,
I always forget your name.

263
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.160
Shmebulock.

264
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.000
Shmebulock. Yes!

265
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.040
Anyways, long story short,

266
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.880
us gnomes have been
lookin' for a new queen.
Right, guys?

267
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.760
Queen! Queen!

268
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.680
Heh! So whaddya say?

269
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.440
Will you join us
in holy matri-gnome-y?

270
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.320
<i>Matri... matri... mony?</i>

271
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.240
<i>Bleahh!
Can't talk today.</i>

272
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.080
Look...

273
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.080
I'm sorry, guys,
you're really sweet,

274
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.840
but I'm a girl
and you're gnomes

275
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.760
and it's like, "what?!"

276
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.720
Yikes.

277
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.320
We understand.
We'll never forget you,
Mabel.

278
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.560
- Because we're gonna kidnap you.
- Huh?!

279
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.200
Don't worry, Mabel!
I'll save you from that zombie!

280
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.080
Help!!!!

281
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.960
Hold on!

282
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.800
The more you struggle,
the more awkward this is
gonna be for everybody.

283
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.640
Just... ha ha!... Okay,
just get her arm there,
Steve.

284
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.600
Aah! Let go of me!

285
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.360
Uhh...

286
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.240
<i>what the heck
is goin' on here?!</i>

287
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.160
Aah!

288
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.000
Dipper! Norman turned out
to be a bunch of gnomes!

289
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And they're total jerks!

290
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.960
Uhh! Hair! Hair!

291
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.800
<i>Gnomes? Huh.
I was way off.</i>

292
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.640
"Gnomes. Little men
of the Gravity Falls forest.

293
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.520
"Weaknesses:" unknown.

294
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.440
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

295
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.360
Hey! Hey!
Let go of my sister!

296
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.240
Oh! Ha ha. Hey there!
Um, ya know,

297
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.440
this is all really just
a big misunderstanding,
ya see?

298
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.080
Your sister's not in danger...

299
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.000
She's just marrying
all one thousand of us

300
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and become our gnome queen
for all eternity.

301
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.840
Isn't that right, honey?

302
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.800
You guys are butt-faces!

303
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.760
<i>Give her back right now,
or else!</i>

304
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.560
You think you can stop us, boy?

305
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.440
You have no idea what
we're capable of.

306
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.400
The gnomes are a powerful race!

307
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.320
Do not trifle with the...

308
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.200
Aaaah!

309
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.000
He's getting away
with our queen!

310
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.960
<i>No, no, no!!!</i>

311
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.960
Seat belt.

312
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.640
You've messed with
the wrong creatures, boy.

313
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.600
Gnomes of the forest...
Assemble!

314
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.040
Hurry! Before they
come after us!

315
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.000
I wouldn't worry about it.

316
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.720
You see their little legs?
Suckers are tiny.

317
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.480
Dang.

318
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.400
All right, teamwork, guys!
Like we practiced.

319
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.160
Move. Move!

320
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.960
- Come back with our queen!
- It's getting closer!

321
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.840
Eh!

322
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.760
Yahh!

323
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.440
Brahh!!

324
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.360
Shmebulock!

325
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.160
I'll save you, Dipper!

326
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.000
Uh! Ow! Uh! Uh!
Uh! Uh! Uh!

327
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.960
Uh!!!

328
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.800
- Thanks, Mabel.
- Don't mention it.

329
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.760
Yahh!

330
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.640
Look out!

331
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.120
Stay back, man!

332
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.080
Uhh!

333
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.840
Where's Grunkle Stan?

334
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.760
Behold!

335
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.720
The world's most
distracting object!

336
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.560
- Oooh!
- Just try to look away... you can't!

337
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.520
I can't even remember
what I was talkin' about.

338
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.320
It's the end of the line, kids.

339
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.160
Mabel, marry us before
we do something crazy!

340
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.120
There's gotta be
a way out of this!

341
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.960
- I gotta do it.
- What?!

342
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.880
Mabel, don't do this!
Are you crazy?

343
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.800
- Trust me.
- What?!

344
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.720
<i>Dipper, just this once...
Trust me.</i>

345
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.480
- All right, Jeff, I'll marry you.
- Hot dog!

346
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.320
Help me down there, Jason.
Thanks. Andy, left foot,

347
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.160
there we go,
watch those fingers, Mike.

348
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.120
Ehh? Ehh?

349
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.960
Bada-Bing, bada-bam!

350
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.880
Now let's get you back
into the forest, honey!

351
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.800
You may now kiss the bride.

352
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.520
Well, uh, don't mind if I do.

353
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.360
Aah!

354
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.200
Hey, wait a minute!
Ahh-aahh...

355
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.160
Whoa! Whoa!
W-what's going on?

356
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.000
Aah! Aaah!

357
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
That's for lying to me!

358
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.920
That's for breaking my heart!

359
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.800
Ow! My face!

360
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.600
<i>And this is for
messing with my brother!</i>

361
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.520
- Wanna do the honors?
- On three.

362
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.440
One, two, three!

363
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.200
I'll... Get you back
for this!!!!!

364
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.200
Who's giving orders?
I need orders!

365
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.040
My arms are tired!

366
00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.920
Anyone else wants some?

367
00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.680
Baaaa!

368
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.400
Hey, Dipper. I, um,

369
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.360
I'm sorry for
ignoring your advice.

370
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.280
You really were just
looking out for me.

371
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.080
Oh, don't be like that.
You saved our butts back there.

372
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.040
I guess I'm just sad
that my first boyfriend

373
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.920
turned out to be
a bunch of gnomes.

374
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.840
<i>Look on the bright side...
Maybe the next one
will be a vampire.</i>

375
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.800
You're just saying that.

376
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.720
Awkward sibling hug?

377
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.600
Awkward sibling hug.

378
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.560
- Pat pat.
- Pat pat.

379
00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.320
Sheesh! You two get hit
by a bus or somethin'?

380
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.280
Aha!

381
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.000
Uh, hey!

382
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.040
W-wouldn't you know it?

383
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.880
Um, I accidentally
overstocked some inventory,

384
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.680
so how's about each of you
take one item from the gift shop
on the house?

385
00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.720
- Really?
- What's the catch?

386
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.560
The catch is do it
before I change my mind.
Now take something.

387
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.480
- Hmm...
- Oooh! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

388
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.280
Hmm. That oughta
do the trick.

389
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.160
And I will have a...

390
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.040
Grappling hook!

391
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.880
- Yes!
- Wouldn't you rather have
a doll or something?

392
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.720
- Grappling hook!
- Fair enough.

393
00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.320
<i>"This journal told me there was
no one in Gravity Falls</i>

394
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.360
<i>"I could trust.</i>

395
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.280
<i>"But when you battle
a hundred gnomes</i>

396
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.120

397
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.080
<i>you realize that they've

398
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.000
Hey, Mabel,
could you get the light?

399
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.840
I'm on it.

400
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.720
It worked!

401
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.720
- Ha ha ha!
- These grappling hooks...

402
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.560
<i>Our uncle told us
there was nothing strange
about this town.</i>

403
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.480
<i>But who knows
what other secrets</i>

404
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.400
<i>are waiting to be unlocked?</i>

405
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.680
Aaah!

406
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.720
Bleahh...

407
00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.600
Eahhh...

408
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.480
Eahhhh...

409
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.400
Eahhh...

410
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.320
Eahhhh...

411
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.360
Eahhh...

412
00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.280
Eahhhh...

413
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.160
Eahhh...

414
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.040
Eahhhh...

415
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.960
Eahhh...

416
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.000
Eahhhh...

417
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.840
Eahhh...

418
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.800
Eahhhh.
