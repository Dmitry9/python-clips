1
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.920
For tonight's final llusion

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.160
we have incredible sack of mystery.

3
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.000
When you put your money in
it mysteriously dissapears.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.720
Well, of course! That makes perfect sense!
What a nice man! That was totaly worth a try!

5
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.280
The tiger was badly injured in the explosion

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.080
but we repaired him
with a fist.

7
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.920
Woo! Yeah! That tiger is our hero!

8
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.800
Tiger fist! will return after these messages.

9
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.000
Hey look! It's that commercial
I've been telling you guys about.

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.040
Are you completely miserable?

11
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.880
Yeees!

12
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.240
Then you need to meet <i>Gideooon</i>..

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.200
- Gideon?
- What makes him so special?

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.080
He's a psychic!

15
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.720
So don't waste your time with other
so called man of mystery.

16
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.760

17
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.080
at Gideon's tent of telepathy!

18
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.120
I'm getting all curiosy inside.

19
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.760
Well don't get too curiosy,

20
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.880
Ever since that monster Gideon
rolled in town, I've had nothing but trouble.

21
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.280
Gideon!

22
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.160
- Well, is he realy psychic?
- I think we should go and find out!

23
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
Never! You're forbiden from patronizing the competition!

24
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.680
Noone that lives under my roof
is allowed under that Gideon's roof.

25
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.760
- Do tents have roofs?
- I think we just found our loophole. Literaly.

26
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.960
So come down soon, folks.
Gideon is expecting you.

27
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.800
Gravity Falls

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.320
Aww, this is like a bizzaro version of a Mystery shack.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.880
They even have their own Soos.

32
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.880
It's starting, it's starting!

33
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.400
Let's see what this monster looks like.

34
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.640
Hello America!
My name is lil' Gideon!

35
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.960
That's Stan's mortal enemy?

36

Like.. he's so.. widdle.

37
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.760

- No wonder our uncle is jealous.
- Oh come on, his dance moves were adorable

60
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.240

Yeah, my song is quite catchy.
I know we haven't formaly met.

67
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.760
but after yesterday's perfomance,
I just couldn't get your laugh out of my head.

68
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.760
You mean this one?

69
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.840
Aw, what a delight. And when I saw you in the
audience, I said to myself

70
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.480
now, there is a kindred spirit. Someone
who apreciates sparkly things of laugh.

71
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.440
That's totaly me!

72
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.280
Enchanting. Utterly enchanting.

73
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.080
- Who's at the door?
- Noone grunkle Stan!

74
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.200
I apreciate your discretion,
that Stan is no fan of mine.

75
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.880
I don't know how a lemon so sour
could be related to a peach so sweet.

76
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.840
- Gideon!
- What do you say, we step

77
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.600
away from here and chat a bit more.
Perhaps in my dressing room?

78
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.440
Makeovers!

79
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.800
Do you see something you like?
Cos I do..

80
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.160
What?

81
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.840
Hey Dipper! What's going oon?

82
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.280
Where have you been? And
what's going on with

83
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.600
those finger nails, you
look like a wolverine.

84
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.680
I know, right? Waaa!

85
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.640
I'm hanging out with my new pal Gideon.
He's one dapper little man.

86
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.040
Mabel, I don't trust anyone
who's hair is bigger than their head.

87
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.160
Aw, leave him alone. You never
wanna do girly stuff with me.

88
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.560
You and Soos could do
boy stuff all the time.

89
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.840
- What do you mean?
- Hey dude.

90
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.000
- You ready to blow up these hotdogs
in a microwave one by one?
- Am I?

91
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.800
One at a time! One at a time!

92
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.680
Wow! The view from your family
factory is nuts!

93
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.960
Good thing we both brought our
Operate glasses!

94
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.200
Mabel, when I'm up here
looking down on all them lil old people.

95
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.040
I feel like I'm king of all I survey.

96
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.560
- And guess that makes you my queen!
- What?

97
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.280
You've being so nice to me right now.

98
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.480
Quit it!

99
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.600
I can't quit it.
I'm speaking from my heart.

100
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.080
- From the where now?
- Mabel, I've never felt this close to anyone.

101
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.040
So..so close.

102
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.120
Look Gideon, I am ..

103
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.360
I like you a lot but let's
just be friends.

104
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.040
At least give me a chance.
Mabel, will you do me the honour

105
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.360
- of going on a date with me?
- A play date?

106
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.880
A shopping date?

107
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.960
It will just be one lil old date.

108
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.920
I swear with my lucky bolo tie.

109
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.000
Okay, then. I guess.

110
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.080
Mable Pines, you have made me
the happiest boy in the world.

111
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.680
Are you sniffing my hair?

112
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.080
It's not a date, Dip,
it's just, you know

113
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.720
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Until he figured it, I'd throw him a bone.

114
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.920
Mabel, guys don't work that way.
He's gonna fall in love with you.

115
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.440
Pff, yeah, right.

116
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.080
I'm not THAT lovable.

117
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.200
- Kaboom! Yes!
- Okay, at least we agree on something here.

118
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.160
A night of enchantment awaits, my lady.

119
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.280
Oh boy.

120
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.760
I can't believe they'd let us bring
horse in here.

121
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.720
Well, people have hard time saying
'no' to me.

122
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.600
Ah! Monsieur Gideon!
The feet on the table!

123
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.120
An excellent choice!

124
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.040
- Jean-Luc, what have we discused about our contac?
- Yes, yes. Very good.

125
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.280
I've never seen so many forks.

126
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.480
And water with bubbles in it?
Oh, ulala, weewee.

127
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.360
Oh, parlez-vous français ?

128
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.680
I have no idea what you're saying.

129
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.240
Hey, hey! What the jackal is Mabel doing
in the paper next to that crazy pitpocket Gideon?

130
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.040
Oh, yeah. That's like a big deal.

131
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.760
Everybody's talking about Gideon
and Mabel's big date tonight.

132
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.200
What? That little shyster is dating my great niece?

133
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.440
I wonder what the new name will be for the
power couple?

134
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.000
Mabidion? Gidiable? Magidbelion!

135
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.040
I didn't know! I didn't hear about it!
And plus, I told her not to!

136
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.840
Yeah, well it ends tonight.
I'm going right down to that little scug's house.

137
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.600
This is gonna stop right now.

138
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.120
Dude, woudn't it be funny if that was a closet?

139
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.640
And he had to come back again and
walk through the real door?

140
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.320
Nope, real door.

141
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.520
Gideon, you little punk!
Open up!

142
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.840
I will pardon nothing!

143
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.200
Why! Stan Pines!

144
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.680
- What a delight!
- Out of the way, bud.

145
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.400
- I'm looking for Gideon.
- Well, I haven't seen the boy around, but since you're here.

146
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.640
You simply must come in for coffee.

147
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.240
- Bu but I came..
- It's imported. All the way from Columbia.

148
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.760
I went to jail there once.

149
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.320
Some digs you got here.

150
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.800
Oh, this. This is beautiful.

151
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.040
Now, I hear your niece
and my Gideon are well,

152
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.160
they are singing in harmony
lately, so to speak.

153
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.880
Yeah, and I'm against it.

154
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.080
No, no, no. I see it as a fantastic
business oportunity.

155
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.280
Yes, the Mystery Shack and
the Tent of Telepathy.

156
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.760
We'd been at each other's throats for far..
Let me get that.

157
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.800
At each others throats for far too long,
yes we have.

158
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.520
This is our big chance to brush aside
our rivalry

159
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.320
and pull our collective profit, you see.

160
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.960
I'm listening.

161
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.080
Autograph your own head, shot lady!

162
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.760
Mabel, tonight's date was a complete success.

163
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.240
And tomorrow date promisses to top
this one in every way!

164
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.160
Woah, woah. You said just one date
and this was it.

165
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.400
What a surprise! A red-crested
south american rainbow maco!

166
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.640
Two.. three.. four..

167
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.960
Mabel! Will! You!
Accompany! Gideon!

168
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.000
To! The ballroom! Dance!
This! Thurpsday!

169
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.200
Thursday!

170
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.720
- Oh so adorable.
- Gideon got a girlfriend.

171
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.240
They're expecting us, please say you'll go.

172
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.120
Gideon, I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to say..

173
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.080
- I'm on the edge of my seat
- This is gonna be adorable.

174
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.120
If she says no, I'll die from sadness.

175
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.240
I can verify that will indeed happen.

176
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.880
Hey! How did it go?

177
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.520
I don't know..
I have a lobster now..

178
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.320
Well, at least it's over and you will never
have to go out with him again.

179
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.240
Mabel, it's over, right?

180
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.520
Mabel?

181
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.560
He asked me out again and I didn't
know how to say NO!

182
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.280
Like this - NO

183
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.200
It's not that easy, Dipper.

184
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.240
I do like Gideon, as a friend/little sister.

185
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.480
So I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
I just need to get things back where they used to be.

186
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.720
You know, friends.

187
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.840
Boat midnight, boat midnight.

188
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.800
You know, I thought dancing would be the end
of the evening, right?

189
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.360
Don't you want this evening to last my sweet?

190
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.760
NO! I mean, yes.
I mean, I'm always happy hanging with a friend.

191
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.800
Buddy, pal, chump, other word for friend.

192
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.080
- Pal?
- I already said pal. A mate?

193
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.000
How about soulmate?

194
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.040
Well, you can't say no to that.

195
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.120
He's so nice, but I
can't keep doing this.

196
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.720
But I can't break his heart.
Aaah! I have no way out!

197
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.560
- What in the heck happened on that date?
- I don't know. I was in the friend-zone

198
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.800
and then before I knew what was happening,
he pulled me into romance zone!

199
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.640
It was like quicksand! Geopardy quicksand!

200
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.880
Mabel, come on. It's not like
you'll have to marry Gideon.

201
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.240
Great news, Mabel.
You have to marry Gideon.

202
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.520
- What?
- It's all a part of my long-term deal with buddy Gleafall.

203
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.480
There's a lot of cash tied up in this thin,
plus I got this shirt.

204
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.760
I am fat.

205
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.960
Bodies change, honey!
Bodies change.

206
00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.520
- Oh no, Mabel.
- Mabel's not here.

207
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.680
- She's in sweater town.
- Are you gonna come out of sweater town?

208
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.480
All right. Enough is enough.

209
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.120
- If you can't break up with Gideon, than I'll do it for you.
- You will?

210
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.240
- Oh thank you, thank you, thank you
- Allright, allright.

211
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.400
Hello! Dipper Pines, how are you?

212
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.600
- You look good, you look good.
- Thanks, you are..

213
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.960
Look, Gideon. We've gotta talk.
Mabel isn't joining you tonight.

214
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.640
She doesn't want to see you anymore.

215
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.600
She's kinda weirded out by you,
no offense.

216
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.120
So what you're saying is..

217
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.920
- You've come between us.
- You're not gonna like

218
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.840
freak out or anything, are you?

219
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.840
Of course not. This things happen.

220
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.560
So, okay cool. Well, then again, sorry man,
but uh..

221
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.240
Hey, thumbs up!

222
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.320
Thumbs up, indeed my friend.

223
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.920
How did it go? Was he mad?
Did he try to read your mind with his psychic powers?

224
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.160
Don't worry Mable, he's just a kid.
He doesn't have any powers.

225
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.240
Dipper Pines, you don't know what you've done.

226
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.720
You've just made the biggest mistake of your life.

227
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.560
Gideon Charles Gleafall, clean up
your room this instant.

228
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.720
I can buy and sell you old man!

229
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.960
Fair enough.

230
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.200
Hit me dude!

231
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.760
- Feels good.
- I'm so glad everything's back to normal.

232
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.360
- Your turn.
- Your tur.. Aw, man.

233
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.480
- Hello?
- Toby Determined, Gravity Falls Gossiper.

234
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.440
Oh, hey man. Sorry for acusing you of murder last week.

235
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.680
Water under the bridge. Saay..

236
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.840
We want to interview you about
whether you've seen anything

237
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.560
unusual in tihs hiertown
ever since you've arrived.

238
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.280
Oh! Finally! I thought nobody would ever ask!
I have notes and theories! Aha..

239
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.040
412 Gopher road. Tonight?

240
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.040
- Got it.
- There! I did your dirty work.

241
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.160
Now it's time to pay your end of the bargain.

242
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.760
Sandra Himeneses phone number!

243
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.880
Bless you, lil Gideon!

244
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.480
Hello!

245
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.160
Hello friend.

246
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.920
- Gideon.
- Dipper Pines.

247
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.280
How long have you been lining in
this town? Week? Two?

248
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.200
You like it here? Enjoying the scenery?

249
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.320
- What do you want from me, man?
- Listen carefully boy.

250
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.640
This town has secrets you couldn't begin
to comprehend.

251
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.720
Is this about Mabel?
I told you, she's not into you.

252
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.160
Liar! You turned her agains me!

253
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.520
She was my peach dumpling!

254
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.120
Are you okay man?

255
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.560
Howdy!

256
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.560
Reading minds isn't all I can do.

257
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.280
But..but you're a fake..

258
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.400
Oh, tell me Dipper. Is this fake?

259
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.880
How's your hair tasting buddy?

260
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.600
Wendy, I need some advice.

261
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.040
- You've broken up with guys, right?
- Oh yeah.

262
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.960
Russ Toram, Elay Hall, Stoney Davidson.

263
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.560
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

264
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.800
I thought everytrhing was back to
normal, but I still feel all gross.

265
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.080
Flake Wurly,  Nate Halls, oh, the guy with the tattoos.

266
00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.560
Maybe letting Dipper do it for me was a mistake.
Gideon deserves an honest break up

267
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.720
Deanny Feldman, Mark Epstin, oh.

268
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.760
Oh man, I'm not sure I actualy broke up with him.
No wonder he keeps calling me.

269
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.640
I know what I gotta do.
Thatnls for talking to me, Wendy.

270
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.480
Ignore.

271
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.640
Grunkle Stan was right about you!
You are a monster!

272
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.000
Your sister will be mine!

273
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.960
- Who's the cute little guy? You are!
- No you are!

274
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.000
- She's never gonna date you, man!
- That's a lie!

275
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.240
And I'm gonna make sure you never lie to me
again, friend.

276
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.240
Gideon! We have to talk!

277
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.200
Mabel! My marshmallow!
What are you doing here?

278
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:04.080
I'm sorry Gideon, but I can't be your marshmallow.
I am here to be honest and tell you that myself.

279
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.400
I..I don't understand.

280
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.080
Mabel, this probably isn't the best time
to be brutaly honest with him!

281
00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.720
Hey, but we can still be makeover buddies, right?

282
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.960
- Woudn't you like that?
- Really?

283
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.960
No! Not really!

284
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.800
- You were like attacking my brother! What the heck?

285
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.160
My tie! Give it back!

286
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.480
Not so powerfull without this, are you?

287
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.440
Dipper!

288
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.160
Listen Gideon. It's over.
I will never ever date you.

289
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.040
Yeah!

290
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.400
My powers!

291
00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:02.320
Oh, this isn't over. This isn't the last you'll
see of lil..ol..me.

292
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.840
This is living brother.

293
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.200
From now on, it's all named brand foods and
clown paintings.

294
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.600
-  Well hehey Gideon, look what..
- Stanpher Pines!

295
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.040
I rebuke thee!
I rebuke thee!

296
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.960
Rebuke? Is that a word?

297
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.240
The entire Pines family
have invoked my fury!

298
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.920
You will all pay recompense
for you transgressions!

299
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.600
What, you got like a
word-a-day calendar or something?

300
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.800
B-but-but but sunshine, what about our
arrangement with Mable and..

301
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.480
Silence!

302
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.560
Well, I see he's taking one of
his rages again.

303
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.480
Sorry, Stan. I'll have to stand with
Gideon on this one.

304
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.320
Okay, okay. I can see when
I'm not wanted.

305
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.320
Stan, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna need
that painting back, Staaan!

306
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.040
Stan!

307
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.520
Try and catch me, suckers!

308
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.040
I could've had it all.

309
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.080
What the heck happened to you two?

310
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.320
- Gideon.
- Gideon.

311
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.480
Gideon.

312
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.720
Yeah, the little mutant swore vengeance
on the whole family.

313
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.880
I guess he's gonna nibble my anckles
or something.

314
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.760
Oh yeah. Yeah! How is he gonna
destroy us now, huh?

315
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.880
Try to think what number we're thinking of?

316
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.560
He'll never guess what
number I'm thinking of.

317
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.600
Negative 8! Noone would guess a negative number!

318
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.120
Oh, look out! Somebody's
planning our destruction right now.

319
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.360
Gideon, I still love you.

320
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.960
If only my family weren't in the way.

321
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.040
Look at me.
I'm old and I'm smelly.

322
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.160
Hey, what are you going to do without
your precious amulet?

323
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.240
Oh, you'll see boy.

324
00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.720
You'll see.

325
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.200
- You're done.
- Not yet.

326
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.400
- How about now?
- Almost.

327
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.760
And.. there.

328
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.760
Let's do this.

329
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.480
You're all fired.
