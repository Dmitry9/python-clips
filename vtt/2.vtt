00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.280
Are you ready for
the ultimate challenge?

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.320
I'm always ready!

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.240
Then you know what this means!

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.040
Syrup race! Ahh...

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.880
- Go, sir syrup!
- Go, mountie man!

6
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.880
- Go go! Go go!
- Almost... Almost...

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.800
Yes!

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.640
I won!

9
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.560
Bleah.

10
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.600
Ho ho, no way!

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440
Hey, Mabel, check this out.

12
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.360
Human-sized hamster balls?

13
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.320
<i>I'm </i>human-sized!

14
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.320
No, no, Mabel. This.

15
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.160
We see weirder stuff
than that every day.

16
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.040
We didn't get any photos
of those gnomes, did we?

17
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.960
Nope, just memories.
And this beard hair.

18
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.880
- Why did you save that?
- Mm-mm-mm.

19
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.800
Uhh! Good morning,
knuckleheads.

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.680
You two know what day it is?

21
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.640
Um... Happy anniversary?

22
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.480
- Mazel tov!
- Baah!

23
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.440
It's family fun day, genius!

24
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.400
We're cuttin' off work
and havin' one of those,
ya know,

25
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.320
Bonding-type deals.

26
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.120
Grunkle Stan, is this
gonna be anything like
our last family bonding day?

27
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.040
You call that Ben Franklin?
He looks like a woman!

28
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.960
Uh-oh!

29
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.840
Ohh! The county jail
was <i>so </i>cold.

30
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.720
All right, maybe I haven't been
the best summer caretaker.

31
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.600
But I swear, today we're gonna
have some <i>real </i>family fun.

32
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.360
Now, who wants to
put on some blindfolds
and get into my car?

33
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.320
- Yay!
- Yay!

34
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.320
Wait. What?

36
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.360
Whoa! Whoa!

37
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.400
Blindfolds never lead
to anything good.

38
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.160
Wow. I feel like
all my other senses
are heightened.

39
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
I can see with my fingers.

40
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.000
- Oh!
- Oh!

41
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.960
Grunkle Stan, are <i>you
</i>wearing a blindfold?

42
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.840
Ha ha! Nah,
but with these cataracts,
I might as well be.

43
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.720
What is that, a woodpecker?

44
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.560
Okay, okay, open 'em up.

45
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.360
Ta-da! It's fishin' season!

46
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.280
- Fishing?
- What are you playing at, old man?

47
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.200
You're gonna love it!
The whole town's out here!

48
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.080
Here, fishy-fishies!
Get into the pan.

49
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.960
Say "cheese."

50
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.000
Aaaah!

51
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.880
Uh, is this good?

52
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.880
No!!!

53
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.720
I'll show you how
a <i>real </i>man fishes!

54
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.560
Grr! Aaah!

55
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

56
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.440
Hyeah! Uhh!

57
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.400
- Dead! Dead!
- Dead! Dead!

58
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.320
Get him!
Get him!

59
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.240
That's some quality
family bonding!

60
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.120
Uncle Stan, why do you
want to bond with us
all of a sudden?

61
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.000
Come on,
this is gonna be great!

62
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.920
I've never had
fishin' buddies before.

63
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.840
The guys from the lodge
won't go with me.

64
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.760
They don't <i>like </i>or <i>trust </i>me.

65
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.600
I think he actually wants
to fish with us.

66
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.560
Hey, I know what'll cheer
you sad sacks up.

67
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.440
Pow! Pines family
fishin' hats.

68
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.360
That's hand-stitching,
ya know.

69
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.240
It's just gonna be you, me,
and those goofy hats
on a boat for ten hours!

70
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.200
Ten hours?!

71
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.040
I brought the joke book.

72
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.920
No. No!

73
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920
There has to be
a way out of this.

74
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.800
I seen it!

75
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.720
I seen it again!

76
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560
Hoo hoo hoo!

77
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.480
The Gravity Falls gobblewonker!

78
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.360
Come quick before he
scramdoodles away!

79
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.280
Ha ha hoo-ah!

80
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.160
Aw. He's doing
a happy jig.

81
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.040
No!!! It's a jig
of grave danger!

82
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.960
- Hey! Hey!
- Aaah!

83
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.880
Now, what did I tell you
about scaring my customers?

84
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.800
This is your last warning, dad.

85
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.600
But I got proof this time,
by gummity!

86
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.520
Behold!

87
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.360
It's gobbledywonker
what done did it!

88
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.280
It had a long neck
like a gee-raffe,

89
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.200
and wrinkly skin like... like
this gentleman right here. - Huh?

90
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.040
It chopped my boat up
to smitheroons!

91
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.960
It shim-shammed over
to scuttlebutt island!

92
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.880
Ya gotta believe me!!!

93
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.800
Attention, all units.

94
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.640
We got ourselves
a crazy old man.

95
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.360
Aw, donkey spittle!
Banjo Polish...

96
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.280
Well, that happened.

97
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.080
Now, let's untie this boat
and get out on that lake!

98
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.040
Mabel, did you hear
what that old dude said?

99
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.960
"Aw, donkey spittle!"

100
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.880
The other thing...
about the monster.

101
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.680
If we can snag a photo of it,
we could split the prize
fifty-fifty.

102
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.600
That's two fifties!

103
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.560
Imagine what you could do
with five hundred dollars!

104
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.240
Not so high and mighty anymore.

105
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.120
- Ohh.
- Aha-ha ha ha ha!

106
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.840
Hey, boys.

107
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.680
You can look...
But you can't touch.

108
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.560
Squeak! Squeak!
Squeak! Squeak!

109
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.520
Squeak squeak...

110
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.440
Awesome!

111
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.360
Mabel. Mabel?

112
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.200
Dipper, I am one <i>million </i>percent
onboard with this!

113
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.160
Grunkle Stan!
Change of plans!

114
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.040
We're taking that boat
to scuttlebutt island,

115
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.840
and we are gonna find
that gobblewonker.

116
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.800
- Monster Hunt!
- Monster Hunt!

117
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.800
- Monster...
- Monster Hunt!

118
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.680
Monster... eh...

119
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.680
I'll go.

120
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.520
You dudes say something
about a monster Hunt?

121
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.360
- Zeus!
- What's up, hambone?

122
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.200
- Kapoosh!
- Pow! Explode!

123
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.160
Dude, you could totally
use my boat for your Hunt.

124
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.040
It's got a steering wheel,
chairs... normal boat stuff.

125
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.960
All right,
let's think this through.

126
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.880
You kids <i>could </i>go
waste your time

127
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.720
on some epic
monster-finding
adventure,

128
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.560
<i>or </i>you could spend the day
learning how to tie knots
and skewer worms

129
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.560
with your great uncle Stan!

130
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So, whaddya say?

131
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.840
We made the right choice!

132
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.680
Ingrates!
Ah, who needs 'em?

133
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.480
I got a whole box
of creepy fishin' lures
to keep <i>me </i>company.

134
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.320
Uhh!

135
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.280
Hoist the anchor!

136
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.040
Raise the flag!

137
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.040
We're gonna find
that gobblewonker!

138
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.880
We're gonna win
that photo contest!

139
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.840
Do any of you dudes
have sunscreen?

140
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.680
We're gonna...
Go get sunscreen!

141
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680
Yay!

142
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.080
All right, if we want to
win this contest,

143
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.960
we've gotta do it right.

144
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.960
Think. What the #1 problem
with most monster hunts?

145
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.720
You're a side character
and you die in the first
five minutes of the movie.

146
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.560
Dude, am I a side character?
Do you ever think about
stuff like that?

147
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.600
No, no, no...
camera trouble.

148
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.480
Say bigfoot shows up.
Zeus, be bigfoot.

149
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.240
There he is! Bigfoot!

150
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.200
Uh-oh! No camera!

151
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.080
Oh, wait! Here's one!

152
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.080
Aw, no film!

153
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.960
You see what I'm doing here?

154
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.000
- Uh-huh.
- Dude's got a point.

155
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.720
That's why I bought
seventeen disposable cameras.

156
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.760
Two on my ankle,
three in my jacket,

157
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.680
four for each of you,
three extras in this bag,

158
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.560
and one under my hat.

159
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.480
There's no way
we're gonna Miss this.

160
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.320
Okay, everybody,
let's test our cameras out.

161
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320
Ahh! Dude!

162
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.200
You see? This is exactly
why you need backup cameras.

163
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.160
We still have sixteen.

164
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.080
Ahh! Bird!

165
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.880
Fifteen. Okay, guys,
I repeat, don't lose
your cameras.

166
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.760
- Wait. Lose the cameras?
- Don't!

167
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.760
Dude, I just threw two away.

168
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.760
Thirteen!

169
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.600
All right, we still
have thirteen camera...

170
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.520
Twelve. We have
twelve cameras.

171
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.400
So what's the plan?
Throw more cameras overboard
or what?

172
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.320
No! No. Okay.

173
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.240
You'll be lookout,
Zeus can work
the steering wheel,

174
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.120
- and I'll be captain.
- What?!

175
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.080
Why do <i>you </i>get to be captain?

176
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.000
What about Mabel, huh?

177
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.880
Ma-bel! Ma-bel!

178
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.760
Ma-bel! Ma-bel!

179
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.760
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

180
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.640
What about co-captain?

181
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.640
There's no such thing
as co-captain.

182
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.520
Ohh. Whoops!

183
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.440
Okay, fine!
You can be co-captain!

184
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.440
Can I be associate
co-captain?

185
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.280
As co-captain,
I authorize that request.

186
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.200
Well, as <i>first </i>co-captain,
our #1 order of business

187
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.120
is to lure the monster out
with this.

188
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.040
Permission to taste some?

189
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.840
- Granted.
- Permission co-granted.

190
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.800
Permission
associate go-granted.

191
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.560
Dude, I don't know what
I expected that to taste like.

192
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.360

I'll find my own

There's my new pals!

195
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.760
Now that we're alone, rosanna,

196
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.720
there's a burning question
which my heart longs
to ask of you.

197
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.640
- Oh, Reginald!

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.280
My ex-wife still
misses me,

201
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.200
but her aim is gettin' better!

202
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.040
Her aim is gettin' better!

203
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.880
Ya see, it's...
it's funny because
marriage is terrible.

204
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.880
What?!

205
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.560
Hey, how's it going?

206
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.440

What was that?
Was it your stomach?

231
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.960
No, my stomach
normally sounds
like whale noises.

Tell me, Dipper,
what's the secret
to your success?

241
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.560
Well, I run away from nothing...

242
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.480
Nothing except for
when I ran away from
my annoying Grunkle Stan

243
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.320
who I ditched in order
to pursue that lake monster.

244
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.200
How right you were to do so.
He looked like a real
piece of work.

I don't often do this,

282
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.960

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.800

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.800
Work them bellows
in the... huh?!

350
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.760
Aw, banjo Polish!

351
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.640
Wha... <i>you?</i>

352
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.560
<i>You made </i>this?

353
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.520
Wha... why?

354
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.520
Well, I...

355
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.360
I, uh...

356
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.320
I just wanted attention!

357
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.200
I still don't understand.

358
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.080
Well, first I just
hootenannied up

359
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.000
a bio-mechanical
brain wave generator,

360
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.960
and then I learned to operate
a stick shift with my beard.

361
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.840
Okay, yeah,
but <i>why </i>did you do it?

362
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.680
Well, when you get to be
an old fella like me,

363
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.600
nobody pays any attention
to you anymore.

364
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.480
<i>My own son hasn't
visited me in months!</i>

365
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.400
<i>So I figured maybe
I'd catch his fancy</i>

366
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.320
<i>with a 15-ton
aquatic robot.</i>

367
00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.280
<i>Wha-ha-ha-ha!
Aha-ha-ha!</i>

368
00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.080
Aha-ha! Aha-ha...
ahh...

369
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.960
In retrospect,
it seems a bit contrived.

370
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.960
You just don't know the lengths
us old-timers go through

371
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.720
for a little quality time
with our family.

372
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.560
Dude.

373
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.440
I guess
the real lake monster
is you two. Heh heh.

374
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.320
Sorry, it just, like, boom,
just popped into my head here.

375
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.240
So... Did you ever
talk to your son about
how you felt?

376
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.040
No, sir, I got to work
straight on the robot.

377
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.960
I made lots of robots
in my day.

378
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.880
Like when my wife left me
and I created a homicidal
pterodactyl-tron,

379
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.840
or when my pal Ernie didn't come
to my retirement party

380
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.760
and I constructed
an 80-ton shame-bot

381
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.560
that exploded
the entire downtown area!

382
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.560
Aha-ha-ha-ha!

383
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.400
Aha... well, time to get back
to work on my death ray!

384
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.240
Any you kids got a screwdriver?

385
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.000
Well, so much for
the photo contest.

386
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.040
We still have
one roll of film left.

387
00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.920
What do you want to do with it?

388
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.680
Ahh.

389
00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.720
Hey! Over here!

390
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.440
What the... kids?

391
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.320
I thought you two were off
playin' spin the bottle
with Zeus.

392
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.280
Well, we spent all day trying
to find a legendary dinosaur.

393
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.040
But we realized
the only dinosaur
we want to hang out with

394
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.040
is right here.

395
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.960
Save your sympathy!

396
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.880
I been having a great time
without ya...

397
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.680
makin' friends,
talkin' to my reflection...

398
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.720
I had a run-in with
the lake police!

399
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.520
Guess I gotta wear
this ankle bracelet now,
so that'll be fun.

400
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.480
So I guess there
isn't room in that boat
for three more?

401
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.080
You knuckleheads
ever seen me thread a hook
with my eyes closed?

402
00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.000
- Five bucks says you can't do it.
- You're on!

403
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.880
Five more bucks
says you can't do it
with your eyes closed

404
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.760
<i>plus </i>me singing at
the top of my lungs!

405
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.720
I like those odds!

406
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.520
- Whoa! What happened to your shirt?
- Long story, dude.

407
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.520
All right.
Everybody get together,
say "fishing."

408
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.480
- Fishing!
- Fishing!

409
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.400
Dude, am I in the frame?

410
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.640
Whaa!

411
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.680
- What was that?
- Mm-mm.

412
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.960
- Who wants to hear a joke?
- Not me.

413
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.800
Huh huh! Yeah, you do!
Here it goes.

414
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.760
Why did the pelican

415
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.600
get kicked out the restaurant?

416
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.560
I don't <i>care.</i>

417
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.400
Because he had a very big bill!

418
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.280
- ♪ LA LA LA LA ♪ yuk yuk yuk!
- Ooh. Boo.

419
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.200
- Blah blah bluh.
- Bad joke. Bad pelican joke.
