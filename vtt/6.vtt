00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.280
I like to get my christmas
shopping done early.

2
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.880
Do you have anything that's
in the spirit of the season?

3
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.920
How about these crystals?

4
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.400
Looks like broken glass.

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.560
What are you? A cop?

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.200
Aw, what is that new thing?

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.360
- Grunkle Stan
- Can we go to the diner?

8
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.840
- We're hungry..
- Hungry..

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.000
Yeah, sure. Soon as this
yahoo makes up his mind.

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.080
Do you have this in another animal?

11
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.480
I'm fine locking him inside if you are.

12
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.120
Puma shirt? Panther shirt.
Puma shirt? Panther shirt.

13
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.960
Puma shirt..

14
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.120
Panther shirt.

15
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.320
Gravity falls
Episode 6 - Dipper vs. Manliness

16
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.880
Get!

17
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.680
Coffee, coffee, coffee!

18
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.240
Go! Go! Go! Go!

19
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.960
Lazy Susan. There's my
little ray of sunshine.

20
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.480
Where were you yesterday?

21
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.360
I got hit by a bus.

22
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.520
- Ha ha, hilarious!
- Thank you!

23
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.720
- You do split plates, right?
- Maybe..

24
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.280
Wrink.

25
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.960
Great. Well I'll split one-fourth
of number seven

26
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.440
plus a free salad dressing for the lady
and a small ketchup plate for a boy.

27
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.080
But grunkle Stan, I want pancakes.

28
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.640
With the fancy flour they use these days?
What am I? Made of money?

29
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.840
Don't worry guys.
Pancakes are on me.

30
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.200
I'm gonna win some by
beating that manliness tester.

31
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.480
- Manliness tester?
- Beating?

32
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.120
He says.. he says he's...

33
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.480
What? What's so funny?

34
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.760
Oh, no offense Dipper, but you
are not exactly manly mannington

35
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.240
Hey I am too manly.. many..
or whatever it is you said.

36
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.360
Face the music kid. You got no muscles,
you smell like baby wipes

37
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.760
and let's not forget
last Tuesday's incident.

38
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.080
♪Disco girl, coming through
That girl is you♪

39
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.880
Don't come in, don't come in!

40
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.720
You're listening to girly
icelandic pop-sensation BABBA?

41
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.200
No.. I wasn't..
That's not important!

42
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.080
Look. Come on guys, I'm prety masculine.
Look at that chesthair.

43
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.280
- Put away! Put away!
- Aaah! So smooth!

44
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.200
My eyes!

45
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.400
Aw man.

46
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.120
Fine, family of little faith.

47
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.080
Get ready to eat your words.
And a plate of delicious pancakes.

48
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.840
Allright Dipper. Time to man handle this..
man handle.

49
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.120
- And one.. And two..
- Quit stalling!

50
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.640
Aw what? This thing must be broken.

51
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.240
It's totally broken guys. It's like
a million years old. It probably ran out of..

52
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.160
steam power or..

53
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.360
It's rickity man. You shouldn't even..

54
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.640
Yes! Pancakes for everyone!

55
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.200
I need to get some chest hair and fast.

56
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.480
I'm fine!
Everything's fine!

57
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.800
- How am I related to that?
- Come on, grunkle Stan.

58
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.760
I'm sure deep down you have a soft side too.

59
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.160
Nothing in here but a
cold dark empty soul.

60
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.200
- Food!
- Thanks there, sugar pot.

61
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.440
I mean.. honey wasp..
kidden baby.. baby cow..

62
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.280
Silly, silly man.

63
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.160
- What was that about?
- Nothing. I don't wanna talk about it.

64
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.880
Talk about what? Why is this table wet?

65
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.080
Wait just a second. I think I
have an idea happening here.

66
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.360
- You..
- No.

67
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.680
- And her..
- Stop it.

68
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.400
- Oh boy.
- You have a thing for lazy Susan!

69
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.240
- You do have a soft side.
- B-but keep it down, will ya?

70
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.520
All right, I admit it. Ok?
It would be nice if she liked me, but

71
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.120
I've been out of the game for so
long I wouldn't know where to start.

72
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.440
I mean, look at her.
She's so classy.

73
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.040
Spin, you damn pies, spin.

74
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.640
Gurnkle Stan, you are a
cranky gross weird old man

75
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.880
but we will get Lazy Susan to like you

76
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.320
because nothing is stronger
then the power of..

77
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.120
- Love?
- Mabel.

78
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.080
To victory!

79
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.960
Not manly enough. Stupid diner.

80
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.720
Stupid lumberjack.

81
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.680
Another hydrant destroyed.

82
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.640
It's a gosh damn mystery.

83
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.120
What if we take off our uniforms
and run around in circles?

84
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.000
Quit reading my mind.

85
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.960
I'm sorry I was looking for a mail man.

86
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.920
Oh what. Are you saying I'm not a male or man?

87
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.840
Is that what are you trying to say? I'm
not male, I'm not a man. Is that..

88
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.320
- Is that what you're getting at?
- Are you crying?

89
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.440
Two..

90
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.680
Three..

91
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.240
Four..

92
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.280
No chesthair yet.

93
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.680
Is it physical? Is it mental?
What's the secret?

94
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.080
You've said it brother. I need help.

95
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.280
For the love of all that's holy..
Run!

96
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.280
Wait. Sorry.

97
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.880
Please don't eat me!
I haven't showered.

98
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.440
And like a week!
And I'm all elbows.

99
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.600
Elbows and gristle.

100
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.000
You!

101
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.160
Gonna finish that?

102
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.600
No.

103
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.680
Can't believe it. Part animal, part human.

104
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.000
Are you some kind of minotaur?

105
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.640
I'm a manotaur!
Half man! Half..

106
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.120
Half taur!

107
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.680
I, like, summon you or..

108
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.760
The smell of jerky summoned me!
Jerky!

109
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.560
I smell..

110
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.120
Emotional issues.

111
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.880
I've got problems, manotaur.

112
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.720
Mayhem related problems.

113
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.920
Well, my own uncle called me a wimp.

114
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.280
And I kinda flunked that
manliness videogame thing..

115
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.360
Hey, you know. You seem prety manly.

116
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.400
Maybe you could give me some pointers?

117
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.440
Very well. Climb at top of my back here, child.

118
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.440
Okay.

119
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.000
Yes! Yes!

120
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.800
Dude, watch out!

121
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.400
This place is amazing.

122
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.280
The gnomes live in the trees.

123
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.240
The mer people live in the
water, because they are losers.

124
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.520
But we manotaurs crush in a mancave!

125
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.360
Beasts! I have brought you a halest child!

126
00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.440
Sup.

127
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.240
This is Pubator, Testasteror,

128
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.680
Patuator and I am Hootspor.

129
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.240
- And you are?!
- My name's Dipper.

130
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.520
Boo! Weak!

131
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.840
The Destructor?

132
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.400
Yeah, that's better. Improvement.

133
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.160
Dipper the Destructor wants us to teach
him the secrets to our manliness.

134
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.120
I need your help! Look at this guys!
Look at this!

135
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.240
I must confer with the high council.

136
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.360
- So, we teach him the man's secrets or what?
- He's a human! I don't like him.

137
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.280
I don't like your face!

138
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.440
I like these guys.

139
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.520
Okay, grunkle Stan. Welcome to the first
day of whatever's left of your life.

140
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.640
First, a 'before' picture.

141
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.160
I never miss a scrap for cartoonity.

142
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.240
Dibly dum, memories.

143
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.040
Let's start out with some roleplaying.

144
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.560
Soos will play Lazy Susan.

145
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.040
I'm soft like a woman.

146
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.000
Grunkle Stan, show me how you aproach a woman.

147
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.280
Remember this is a safe
nonjudgemental environment.

148
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.440
I'll just be right off to the side judging
you on the scale from one to ten.

149
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.520
Can I borrow some money?

150
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.960
This is gonna be harder than I thought.

151
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.320
After a lot of punching, we have decided to
deny your request to learn our manly secrets.

152
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.800
Denied!

153
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.600
Denied?

154
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.680
Okay, fine. That's okay with me.

155
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.200
Obviously you guys think it
would be too hard to train me.

156
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.880
Maybe, you're not man enough to try.

157
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.600
What? Not man enough?

158
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.960
- Destructoor..
- Not man enough?!

159
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.160
- He didn't mean it.
- I have three Y chromosomes!

160
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.000
Six adam's apples! Packs on my abs!

161
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.880
And fists for nipples!

162
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.720
Seems to me, you're scared to
teach me how to be a man. Wait.

163
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.280
Do you guys hear it? It sounds like..

164
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.080
Oh, that's weird.

165
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.120
What's that?

166
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.440
That sounds like..
Yeah! A bunch of chickens!

167
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.720
- I feel all weird.
- He's using some sort of brain magic.

168
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.920
After a second round of delibiration, we
have decided to help you becom a man!

169
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.680
Man! Man! Man!

170
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.560
Great! Thanks guys, whatever it is,
I will not let you down.

171
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.680
Being a man is about conquering your fears.

172
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.760
For your first mantask, you must
plunge your fists into the pain hole!

173
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.920

- What do you think?

182
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.880

last few hours have been..

194
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.040
I feel like there's really been some growth.

I have a growth.

198
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.960
- Oh, stop.
- No. You know what, you really have been.

199
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.880
I feel like I'm finally becoming a man here.

200
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.240
Not yet Destructor.
One final taks remains.

201
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.480
- Hey, quit it!
- You quit it!

202
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.560
The deadliest trial of all.

203
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.200
I've survived 49 other trials.
Whatever it is, bring it on!

204
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.880
Behold our leader, Leaderar!

205
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.600
Is he like oldest or wisest or..

206
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.240
Greetings, young..

207
00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.840
Nah, he's just an offering.
That is Leaderar.

208
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.120
You! You wish to be man?

209
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.680
Yeah!

210
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.880
Then you must to heroic act.
Go to highest mountain.

211
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.000
And bring back head of the Multibear!

212
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.600
The Multibear? Is that some sort of bear?

213
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:34.720
He's our sworn enemy. Conquer him and
your mansformation will be complete.

214
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.040
Conquer? I don't know man.

215
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.640
Destructor, is this yours?

216
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.080
Um, no! I don't know whos that is. I'm
just borrowing it. It's friend's. Not mine.

217
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.000
I don't know about this.

218
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.960
I shall conquer the Multibear!

219
00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.640
I'm okay.

220
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.160
I'm coming for you, Multibear.

221
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.200
Okay, grunkle Stan.
You started like this.

222
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.360
But you've became..

223
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.200
- Can I scratch myself now?
- No! No, no, no!

224
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.320
Is that throu up on your shirt?

225
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.840
I don't know how to answer that.

226
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.280
Face it Mabel, your uncle in unfixable.

227
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.360
Like that spinning pietrally thing in the diner.

228
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.880
Grunkle Stan, come with me.

229
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.400
- And leave your pants at home.
- With pleasure.

230
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.600
What is a Multibear?

231
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.000
That's a Multibear.

232
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.840
Bear heads! Silence!

233
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.760
Child, why have you come here?

234
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.920
Multibear! I seek your head!

235
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.040
One of them. Anyway, there's like six. Six heads?

236
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.360
This is foolish. Leave now or die.

237
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.880
So be it.

238
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.480
A real man shows no mercy.

239
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.920
Very well, warrior. But will you grant
a magical beast one last request?

240
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.880
- Um, okay.
- I wish to die, listening to my favourite song.

241
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.480

Yeah, that's it. Press and hold.

257
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.120
It's Beardy.

258
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.160
You keep telling me that being
man is doing all these tasks and

259
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.440
and being aggro all the time, but I'm
starting to think that stuff's malarkey.

260
00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.520
You heard me, malarkey!

261
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.920
So maybe I don't have muscles or
hair in certain places and sure.

262
00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.080
when the girly pop song come on the
radio sometimes I leave it on.

263
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.480
Cos dangit, top 40 hits are in the top
40 for a reason. They are catchy.

264
00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.640
Destructor, what are you saying?

265
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.200
I'm saying the Multibear is a
really nice guy and you're

266
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.560
a bunch of jerks if you want
me to cut off his head.

267
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.240
Kill the Multibear or never be a man.

268
00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.560
Then I guess I'll never be a man.

269
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.160
Boo! Weak!

270
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.640
Hey guys! Who wants to go build something and knock it down?

271
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.880
Man! Man! Man!

272
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.120
Spin! Spin!

273
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.040
Lazy Susan, listen.

274
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.400
I know he's not much to look at,
but you're always fixing stuff in the diner.

275
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.560
and if you like fixing stuff,
nothing could use more fixing than my grunkle Stan!

276
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.360
Also women live longer that man, so your dating pool
is smaller and you really should lower your standarts.

277
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.400
So, Lazy Susan?
What do you say?

278
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.320
Hey! Here's my number!

279
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.640
Why don't you give me a call sometime?

280
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.800
- Really?
- Really.

281
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.120
Also, here's some pie.

282
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.600

We did it! When are you gonna call?
You wanna call now?

284
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.840
I don't have a phone. Let's buy a phone.
We can put it on a creadit card. Let's get a credit card.

285
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.120
Mabel. Let a man enjoy his pie, huh?

286
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.600
Dipper! It's me! Mabel!

287
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.320
I'm looking at you through the glass!

288
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.360
Right here! This is my voice!

289
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.160
I'm talking to you from inside!

290
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.560
- Did you just me through..
- Yes.

291
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.720
- What's wrong?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

292
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.680
- Good
- It's just these halfmen, halfbullhumanoids

293
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.480
- were hanging out with me.
- Here we go.

294
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.600
Then they wanted me to do this really tough
horrible thing but it just wasn't right.

295
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.000
- And I said no.
- You were your own man and stood up for yourself.

296
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.560
- Huh?
- You did what was right, even though noone agreed with ya.

297
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.120
Sounds pretty manly to me,
but what do I know?

298
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.760
Wait a minute? Do my eyes decieve me?

299
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.480
You have a chest hair!

300
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.480
You're right! I do!

301
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.160
This is amazing! I really do!

302
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.880
Take that Mantester!
Take that Patuator!

303
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.680
- Patuator?
- This guy has chest hair!

304
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.040
Scrap for cartoonity!

305
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.080
Don't worry kid. If you're anything like
me, there's more where that came from.

306
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.480
Aw, gross.

307
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.360
Seriously, that's disgusting.

308
00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.800
Oh, not again!

309
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.360

My cat also wants to say hi.

313
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.000
Say hi, Donald!

314
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.560
