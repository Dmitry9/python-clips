00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.880
Mabel, do you believe in ghosts.

2
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.040
I believe you're a big dork, ha ha!

3
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.240
Soos, Wendy.

4
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.840
- What's up, Mr. Pines?
- I'm heading out.

5
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.720
You two are gonna wash the bathrooms, right?

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.520
- Yes sir.
- Absolutely not.

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.760
You stay out of trouble.

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.840
Hey guys. What's this?

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.480
A secret ladder to the roof?

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.520
I don't think Mr. Pines would like that.

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.560
You're freaking me out dude.

12
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.120
- Can we actualy go up there?
- Sure we can.

13
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.320
- Rooftime! Rooftime!
- Rooftime! Rooftime!

14
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.800
- Alright, check it out.
- Woah, cool!

15
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.480
Did you put all these stuff up here?

16
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.320
I may or may not sneak up here
during work all the time, every day.

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.480
Yesss!

18
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.120
- Alright.
- Me first.

19
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.440
Jackpot! Highfive.

20
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.240
Don't leave me hanging.

21
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.760
Hey, it's my friends.

22
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.720
Wendy!

23
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.560
You guys aren't gonna tell Stan
about this, are you?

24
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.480
Later dorks.

25
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.040
Let's get out of here!

26
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.680
Later Wendy!

27
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.480
Good times.

28
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.920
- What?
- Somebody's in love!

29
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.880
Yeah, right. I just think
Wendy is cool, okay?

30
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.680
It's not like I lay awake at
night thinking about her.

31
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.600
Gravity Falls
Episode 5 - Inconveniencing

32
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.160
We're having a party for no reason!

33
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.720
Go! Go! Go!

34
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.920
- Dipper.
- What? Yes, yes.

35
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.960
- Aren't you gonna get in on this?
- I don't realy dance.

36
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.840
Yeah, you do. Mom used to dress him
up in a lamb costume and make him do..

37
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.600
The lamby dance.

38
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.160
- Now is not the time to talk about the lammy dance.
- Lamb costume?

39
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.640
Wow, is there like little ears and
a tail or..

40
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.800
Dipper would prance around
and sing a song about grazing.

41
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.120
Hey, look at that.
Quitting time, the gang is waiting for me.

42
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.920
Hey, wait. Maybe I could
we could come with you.

43
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.320
Uhh, I don't know. My friends
are prety intense.

44
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.080
How old did you guys say you are?

45
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.840
We're thirteen, so technically a teen.

46
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.760
Allright, I like your moxy kid.

47
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.840
Let me get my stuff.

48
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.160
Since when are we thirteen?

49
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.240
Is this a leap year?

50
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.920
Come on Mable. This is our chance to
hang out with, you know, the cool kids.

51
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.040
- And Wendy and whatever.
- I knew it!

52
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.320
You love her!
Love love love love love!

53
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.800
- Oh hey what's that?
- Huh?

54
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.400
- Hurry up!
- In the belly! In the belly!

55
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.320
- Wendy!
- Wendy! Wendy!

56
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.200
Hey guys. These are my pals from
work - Mabel and Dipper.

57
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.880
I chewed my gum so it looks like a brain.

58
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.400
She's not much for the first impressions.
Unlike this guy.

59
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.080
This guy..

60
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.280
So are you like babysitting or?

61
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.600
Come on, Robbie. Guys,
this is Lee and Nee.

62
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.120
- Tambry.
- Haa..

63
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.480
- Thompson who once ate a rotten waffle for 50 cents.
- Don't tell them that.

64
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.160
And Robbie. You can probably figure him out.

65
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.120
Yeah. I'm the guy who spray painted the watertower.

66
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.280
- Aw, you mean the big muffin.
- Um, it's a giant explosion.

67
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.800
Kinda does look like a muffin.

68
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.800
Let's hurry it up, guys.
I've got big plans for tonight.

69
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.200
Sorry kid, I'll ride shotgun, alright?

70
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.440
Okay, just before we go,
my mom said you guys

71
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.080
aren't allowed to punch
the roof anymore, so..

72
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.760
Thompson! Thompson! Thompson!

73
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.560
Ты воняешь.

74
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.000
Ты хорошо сегодня выглядишь.

75
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.960
- This is gonna blow someone's mind!
- Mabel, please.

76
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.440
What? Am I embarassing you in front of your new
GIRLFRIEND

77
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.760
Did you just lick my hand?

78
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.000
You're watching black and white
period piece old lady broing movie channel.

79
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.960
Kids! I can't find the remote and I refuse to stand up!

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.920

There it is fellas.

86
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.240
The condemned dusk2dawn.

87
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.480
- Neato! Awesome!
- Why did they shut it down?

88
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.440
- It's like healthcode violation or..
- Try murder.

89
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.400
Some folks died in there.
The place has been haunted ever since.

90
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.920
This town has such a colourful history!

91
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.040
What? Are you guys serious?

92
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.280
Yeah! We all gonna die!

93
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.640
Chill out man. It's not as
bad as it looks.

94
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.720
- Come on Dipper.
- Haha, okay.

95
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.200
Just just gotta get a foothold.

96
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.640
Dude, your sister did it.

97
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.240
Hey, you know what?
Just there you go.

98
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.640
- Sorry dude.
- Good job throwing a kid off the fence genius.

99
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.920
Your mom's a genius.

100
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.640
This place is amazing!

101
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.520
- Think it's, it's stuck.
- Let me take a crack at it.

102
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.200
- Aw yeah. I can't get in, but I'm sure Junior
here's gonna break it down like Hercules.

103
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.200
Come on, leave him alone.
He's just a little kid.

104
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.400
Hey, what are you doing?

105
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.520
Go Dipper! Punch that metal thing!

106
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.520
Hey, Dipper. Take it easy.

107
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.320
Who wants to bet he doesn't make it?

108
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.600
Haha, awesome.

109
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.520
- Good call inviting this little maniac.
- Your new name is Doctor Funtimes.

110
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.720
All right. Cool.

111
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.720
Nice work.

112
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.760
- Do you guys realy think it's haunted?
- Naah.

113
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.000
- Thompson, are you kidding me?
- Come on, shut up man.

114
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.040
Look at this place. No way.
Wow, what is this? Check it out.

115
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.320
Hoho, man. It's even creepier than
I imagined.

116
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.480
Yup, it's dust.

117
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.600
- Dude, where do you think they keep the dead bodies?
- Shut up man.

118
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.360
Guys check it out.
You think these still work?

119
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.160
Nice. Cool.
Unbelievable.

120
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.520
Jackpot.

121
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.560
- So what are we gonna do now?
- Anything we want?

122
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.040
Put them in, put them in.
Three at a time, three at a time.

123
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.160
Ohmygosh.
Smile dip!

124
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.240
I thought this stuff was banned in America!

125
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.360
Maybe they had a good reason.

126
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.520
- Take a mirror man, we gotta ready.
- Whatever it is, I'll do it!

127
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.200
Thompson! Dipper, this night is like legendary.

128
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.120
- Realy?
- Just look around! The guys are bonding.

129
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.840
I've never even seen Tambry look up from her
phone this long.

130
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.600
And your sister seems to be going
nuts with that smile dip.

131
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.440
Maybe I've had too much.

132
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.000
What do you think?

133
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.760
Do you like to eat my candy paws?

134
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.720
Of course you little angel.

135
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.520
You know Dipper. I wasn't sure if you
can hang out with our crew at first.

136
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.160
- but you're suprisingly mature for your age.
- Yes. Yes I am.

137
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.280
Hey guys! We need more ice!

138
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.640
I'm on it!

139
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.040
What was that? Thought I
heard some lady screaming.

140
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.400
- You freaking out kid?
- Em, no.

141
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.400
- No, I'm cool. Everything's cool.
- Then what's all this about?

142
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.640
Oh, that's.. Em..
Hey look! Dancy pants revolution!

143
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.720
The game that tricks people into excercising.

144
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.160
All right, let's go.

145
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.400
Yeah, let's all go play that.

146
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.640
Dance! Hurry up!

147
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.760
Go! Go! Go!

148
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.120
- Wow, he's realy terrible at this.
- Yeah, yeah. That's great.

149
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.560
I'll be right back.

150
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.160
Come on grunkle Stan, pick up!

151
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.480
Oh, what is he doing?

152
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.360
I don't care about dukes or comonners
or his royal highness linell of conwoll

153
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.560
I'm not afraid anymore, mother.

154
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.440
- Duchess, I forbid you.
- I may be a duchess.

155
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.120
But I'm also a woman!

156
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.440
Yes! Yes! In your face Elizabeth!

157
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.560
It's just like my life.

158
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.920
In a way.

159
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.640
Mabel, I need your advice.
We're hanging out in a haunted

160
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.680
convinient store, I can't
get a hold of grunkle Stan

161
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.080
and if I try to say anything
about it to any of these guys,

162
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.320
they'll just think I'm a scared
little kid or something!

163
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.960
Mabel?

164
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.080
Future is in the past! Onward sailshoma!

165
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.040
Mabel?! How many of these did you eat?

166
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.440
Pleven.. teen..

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.760
Oh man..
Oh man, oh man, oh man..

168
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
Woah, guys. You might wanna see this.

169
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.000
What the heck?

170
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.920
Wow, then the rumours are true.

171
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.960
- Dude, tear you to lie down in it.
- Good idea, go lie down in it.

172
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.840
Huh, I'm a dead body, look.

173
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.160
Wait! Maybe let's not do that.

174
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.720
This guy is scaared.

175
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.160
All I'm saying is why tempt the fate?

176
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:18.440
I mean, what if this place realy is..
haunted?

177
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.840
- Eh, just take it down a notch Captain Buzzkill.
- But I thought I was Doctor Funtimes.

178
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.000
Well, you're acting like Captain Buzzkill, right?

179
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.240
Yeah, little bit.

180
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.000
Status update: Traped in store with
insane nine year old.

181
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.560
I'm not a nine year old! I'm thirteen!
Technically a teen!

182
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.720
Status update: Aaaaah!

183
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.040
Tambry! Tambry!

184
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.720
Can you hear us?

185
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.680
- What are we supposed to do?
- I don't know man, I don't know!

186
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.960
Let's just go already.

187
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.520
- Thompson!
- Wait, I almost got the highscore.

188
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.920
- What?
- Time to shake what your momma gave you!

189
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.440
- No! Help! So manny arrows!
- You're a dance machine!

190
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.400
No, you're a dance machine!

191
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.600
- Oh no!
- Thompson!

192
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.640
Forget him, let's go!

193
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.120
What the? Guys, it's locked!

194
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.320
Out of my way!

195
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.960
Everybody wait! Whatever is doing this
must have some kind of reason.

196
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.480
Maybe if we could just figure out what it is,
then they let us out of here.

197
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.120
Uh, they let us out of here.
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

198
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.040
I don't know guys,
maybe he's got a point.

199
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.240
Yeah, right. I'm sure the ghost just wants
to talk about his feelings.

200
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.600
What?

201
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.880
I'm bonkers free to eat you alive!

202
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:12.800
Lee!

203
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.800
Okay, okay. I'm with you kid.
100% man.

204
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.440
Weeeelcooome.

205
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.360
They got Mabel!

206
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.640
Welcome to your graves,
young trespassers.

207
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.640
We're supersorry for
hanging out in your store!

208
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.800
- Yeah, can we just go
now and leave forever?

209
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.360
Well, okay. You're free to go.

210
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.760
But before you leave,
hotdogs are now half off.

211
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.400
I know this might be crazy,
but you gotta try these dogs.

212
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.320
Just kidding about the hotdog sale!

213
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.120
- Just let us out of here already!
- I don't like your tone!

214
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.600
No! No!

215
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.720
What? No! I'm a hotdog!

216
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.320
It begins!

217
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.360
Welcome to your home for all eternity!

218
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.840
- What do we do?
- Duck!

219
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.920
Quick! In there!

220
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.280
- What do they want from us?
- Revenge I guess?

221
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.040
- What did we do wrong?
- Okay, let's try to figure out a pattern here.

222
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.280
Why was each person taken? Tambry was texting,
Thompson was playing a videogame,

223
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.920
Lee was being sarcastic.
It doesn't make any sense.

224
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.000
Yeah, I mean. Those are all
just normal teenage things.

225
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.080
Wendy, say that last part again.

226
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.200
- Normal teengae things.
- Of course!

227
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.800
Stay here untill I get back!

228
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.960
Dude, what are you doing?

229
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.920
Hey ghost!

230
00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.680
I've got something to tell you!

231
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.840
I'm not a teenager!

232
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.640
Well, why didn't you say so?

233
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.440
- How old did you say you were?
- I'm..

234
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.000
I'm twelve. Technically not a teen.

235
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.240
When we were alive, teenagers
were a scourge at our store.

236
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:29.640
Always satufracing customers with their
boomy boxes and disrespectful short pants.

237
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:36.160
So we decided to up and ban them. But they
retaliated with this new fanglords rap music.

238
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.200
The lyrics, they were so hateful.

239
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.560
Homework's wack and so are rules,
Tacking in your shirts for fools.

240
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.320
Nooo!

241
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.000
It was so shocking, we were stricken
down by a double heart attack

242
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.280
That's why we hate teenagers so much.
Don't we honey?

243
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.560
But they are my friends. Isn't there anything
I can do to help them?

244
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.880
There is one thing

245
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.600
Do you know any funny little dances?

246
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.800
- Is there anything else I can do?
- Noooo!

247
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.160
Okay, okay, okay!
Um.. Well..

248
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.040
I do know the lamby lamby dance.

249
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.160
B-but I can't realy do it, without a lamb costume.

250
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.720
Oh, well. There it is.

251
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.680
Weell. Who wants a lamby, lamby, lamby?

252
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.400
I do! I do!

253
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.520
So go up and greet your mammy, mammy, mammy!
Hi there! Hi there!

254
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.080
- March march march around the daisies!
- Yes, yes! More! More!

255
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:46.440
Don't don't don't you forget about the baby!

256
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.640
That was some fine girly dancing boy.

257
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.160
Your friends are free.

258
00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.480
Well, I don't think you have to worry about
us coming back, so..

259
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.120
I'm not gonna eat or do anything ever again.

260
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.680
- Hey, there's still some left.
- Evil!

261
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.760
What.. What happened after
everythign went crazy?

262
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.520
You are not going to believe it!

263
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.040
Ghosts appeared and Dipper had to..

264
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.320
Dipper just grabed a bat and just started
beating ghost down, left and right.

265
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.360
And then the ghost got all scared
wayed away like a couple of little girls.

266
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.520
- It was insane.
- No way.

267
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.400
Well, I'm probably scared for life.

268
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.320
Yeah, that was prety crazy.

269
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.360
Think I'm gonna stare at the wall for a while
and rething everything.

270
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.520
Hey, next time we hang out,
let's stay at the Mystery Shack, okay?

271
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.360
Next time? Yeah, yeah!
Let's hand out at the shack!

272
00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.800
Next time.

273
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.160
What kind of sick joke is this?

274
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.160
Ah, the wedding. I've waited so long for this.

275
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.920
Oh look at her in that dress.

276
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.200
Count Lionell? What's he doing here?

277
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.040
I've come to reclaim my bride.

278
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.960
- You had your chance at the cottilion, you!
<i>- You had your chance at the cottilion, you!</i>

279
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.320
That's what I'm saying!

280
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.200
Couldn't find the remote
